As I [tweeted](https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/463337022246387714) earlier today, it seems that many websites are putting their advertisers in front of their users. 

Literally.

I've started screenshotting these offenses, and then running them through [Skitch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/skitch-snap.-mark-up.-share./id425955336?mt=12) and highlighting the important stuff. 

#### Today's winner:

[Macworld](http://www.macworld.com)

Macworld on the iPad is horrendous. I like the content, being the Apple nerd that I am. But going to the actual site is a nightmare. Here's the screenshot:

Let's go over this together. 

  * The blue box, you can't get rid of. That's just part of the iPad UI.
  * The top green box is the site header, that's acceptable.
  * The orange box is the nav bar. Again, necessary and appropriately sized for the screen.
  * The Big Red Box is an ad for Tekserve. It's a great store here in New York and I go there often. But the ad is bigger than the iPad UI, the site branding, and the site navigation COMBINED.
  * The next green box is more branding. In this case, it's a banner with the title of the series, Mac 911. This may be necessary, but instead of a generic tagline, the title of the article would be helpful here, especially given the screen size.
  * Next, another Big Red Box with another ad for TekServe. In case you missed the ENTIRE MIDDLE THIRD OF THE SCREEN.
  * Finally, in a small box in the lower left, you can see the top half of the graphic introducing the article about iWork. I assume it's about iWork, because I recognize the icons in the picture. But, nowhere on the page ("above the fold" for you newspaper lovers out there), is any indication of the subject.

I get that websites have to advertise to make money. I also get that no one will read your website if they can't actually see the content. I'd like to see the click-through numbers on the giant banner ad vs. the tasteful sidebar ad.
