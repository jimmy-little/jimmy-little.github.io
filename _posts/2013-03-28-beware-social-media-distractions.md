While the social media savvy were busy changing their avatars to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/humanrightscampaign?fref=ts" target="_blank">red equality signs</a>, (or<a href="http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/03/27/12-parodies-of-the-human-rights-campaigns-red-equal-sign/" target="_blank"> creative parodies</a> of red equality signs) and the media were showing slideshows of court sketches and playing audio recordings of endless hours of Supreme Court testimony about DOMA and same sex marriage, something else happened.
  
  
  
<a href="http://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20130318/BILLS-113hr933eas.pdf" target="_blank">HR 933</a> [PDF link], the 2013 spending bill, was signed into law by President Obama.  In addition to setting the budget for 2013 to keep certain government offices open and running, there was a little amendment in there called Section 735.  Go ahead.  Click on the link, scroll down to Section 735 (on page 78), and see if you can make out what it means.  
  
  
  
I'll wait.
  

  
Welcome back.  Did you figure it out?  It means that even if the FDA or any other government agency discovers in the future that genetically modified crops are dangerous, the government can do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to stop the sale or require the labeling of genetically modified foods.
  
  
  
Despite a petition with over 200,000 signatures; despite the fact that Monsanto and companies like them have utterly destroyed the farming industry and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the process; despite the fact that there is no evidence that genetically modified foods can be considered safe;  despite the fact that even Hungary was smart enough to <a href="http://www.secretsofthefed.com/hungary-destroys-all-monsanto-gmo-corn-fields/" target="_blank">kick out Monsanto</a>; and despite the fact that genetically modified seeds have been <a href="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/press-releases/887/usda-urged-to-deny-approval-of-illegal-genetically-engineered-rice-found-in-food-chain" target="_blank">illegally approved</a>; it has been put into law that we can now no longer remove these questionable foods from our supply, or even have them labeled as modified.  

Personally, I trust genetically modified foods, for the most part.  Seedless grapes aren't natural, y'all.  But consumers deserve the right to know what they're eating, and the government should be able to regulate this if, in the future, a problem is discovered.
  
  
  
I am absolutely for same-sex marriage and equality for all, but I wonder how many people changed their Twitter profile picture to fake corn...
