It's Election Day in America! Go out and vote. Even Google changed their home page to remind you!

If you like the way things are going and want to keep the train rolling, go vote.

If you're like me and you're disheartened, angry, worried for the future, and pissed in general at the current state of things, go vote!

If you don't vote, you don't have a voice. I know it sometimes feels like even the people you vote for don't give a shit what you think, and that's true. But sometimes they actually listen. 

Give them something to listen to.
