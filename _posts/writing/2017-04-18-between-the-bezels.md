Boy Genius reviewed the new Samsung Galaxy S8, and it's terrible. Not the phone, the review. 

Let's start with the title:

>Samsung Galaxy S8 review: Meet the envy of every iPhone user

Ugh.

By all accounts, Samsung has hit it out of the park with the S8 design. It looks like a great device, and is obvioulsly leading the way for the next couple years of phone design.

But, Zach Epstein's review is garbage.

<!-- more -->

 >They’re industry leaders in terms of specs, as Samsung’s flagship phones always have been.
 
 True, but specs aren't the story, perfomance is. And Apple's year-old A10 [beats](http://appleinsider.com/articles/17/04/17/apple-a10-iphone-7-speeds-past-samsung-galaxy-s8-google-pixel-lg-g6-bbk-3t-with-2x-ram) current flagship Android phones. Hell, even Apple's 2015-era iPhone SE beats some of them.
 
 
  >They look and feel like the future, and Apple’s three-year-old iPhone design is stuck in the past.
  
  Can't argue with that. The Samsung looks great, and three years ago *was* in the past.
  
  >Also of note, Samsung managed to make its new flagship phones IP68 water-resistant without removing the 3.5mm headphone jack
  
It wouldn't be an Android review without a dig at the headphone jack removal. Even if several Samsung phones failed [Consumer Reports waterproof tests](http://www.consumerreports.org/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-s7-active-fails-consumer-reports-water-resistance-test/). But let's not talk about it, because HEADPHONES!

Zach does complement Apple's home button, saying: 

>On the Galaxy S8, pressing the home button feels like pressing a plain old touchscreen, and presses are accompanied by the same weak vibration feedback you’d find on any other phone.

When refering to the newer 18:9 aspect ratio, things take a turn to the weird.

>For example, the 5.8-inch display on the smaller Galaxy S8 is technically bigger than the screen on Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus phablet, but Apple’s screen is wider than the one on the S8. 

It's framed as if *Apple* is the outlier, with their "wide" aspect ratio on their "phablet". The reality is Samsung's ratio is the new one, it should be called out as *taller*. 

16:9, 18:9. 

THE :9 WIDTH IS THE SAME. Point out the DIFFERENT thing, man.

> As long as they don’t explode, Samsung appears to have done a fine job with the batteries in the Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+.

"As long as they don't explode, they're fine" should be Samsung's new marketing hook.

>The back of a phone is an awful, awful place for a fingerprint scanner. Even after you’ve spent months with a phone and you know it like the back of your hand, unlocking a smartphone with a rear-mounted fingerprint scanner means blindly sliding your finger around the back before finding the scanner.

This I can agree with. I'm not a fan of rear-mounted fingerprint scanners. But don't worry, you can unlock the phone with your face!

>there are plenty of other ways to unlock your Galaxy S8. Beyond PINs, patterns, and passcodes, the S8 and S8+ also support iris scanning and facial recognition. The latter isn’t terribly secure since it has already been discovered that it can be fooled with a photo.

Oh, never mind. Keep fumbling for the fingerprint scanner, which is inexplicably right next to the camera lens, ensuring your grubby mitts will keep the lens well-smudged.

Then, we get to "The Samsung Experience" layer of software layered on top of Android:

>Each year, Samsung continues to strip away more and more clutter, moving ever closer to a stock Android experience. Closer, yes, but make no mistake — there’s nothing stock about the Android build on Samsung’s Galaxy S8 and S8+.

How do "moving ever closer to stock" and "there's nothing stock about it" make sense in the same sentence? My brain hurts.

-----

The bottom line, for me, is: **Hardware design doesn't matter right now**. We can all relive the 2007-2010 days of making fun of Samsung for copying Apple's designs. Those days are gone. Every phone is a slab of glass. Every laptop is an aluminum wedge, every router is a hockey puck. We get it. 

Until the next major design revolution comes along, glass slabs will just get thinner bezels and thinner profiles. If I have a choice of an iOS phone with big honkin' bezels or thin ones, I'll take the thin one. But I'm not jumping to another OS just because of a pretty phone.

It's about the software, not the hardware.

It's about what's inside that slab of glass or aluminum wedge. Android is great (so I hear), and I know a lot of people who love it. I'm not one of them. I loved my PalmOS, and I am firmly in the iOS camp. I will never notice smaller bezels on a phone if I don't like what's between the bezels.
