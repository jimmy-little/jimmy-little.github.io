title: "Microsoft's Irony"

Short one today, folks.  Apparently, Microsoft&trade; is trying to block Apple&trade;'s trademark application for the term "App Store." (<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.techflashpodcast.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/ttabvue-91195582-OPP-5.pdf" target="_blank">here's the actual motion</a>)

They say "App Store" is a generic term used to describe a place to buy applications.  As a long-time mobile technology user, I have to disagree.  I've used Palm and Windows Mobile devices since the Palm Pilot came out in 1997.  Never once did I go anywhere that was called the "App Store" until the iPhone&trade; went 2.0 and Apple&trade; opened their App Store.
  
While it is part of the lexicon now, it doesn't mean it's generic.  Kleenex&trade; and QTip&trade; are trademarked.  I've never heard someone ask me for a cotton swab.  

Google&trade; gets it.  They call their store the Android Market&trade;.  They understand that Apple&trade; has the right to "App Store".  Microsoft&trade;, you already use the term "Marketplace&trade;" <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.windowsmarketplace.com/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://marketplace.windowsphone.com/Default.aspx" target="_blank">here</a>.  Why are you trying to snarf someone else's term?
  
And here's the best part:  Despite Microsoft&trade;, Google&trade;, Apple&trade;, and Linux all basing their OSes off of IBM&trade;and Xerox&trade;'s windowed GUI approach, you trademarked the term "Windows&trade;" long ago.  If everyone is using desktop windows to present information, isn't that just as generic?  Microsoft&trade; did not call the little box on your screen that holds information a "window" first.  But they were smart enough to trademark it early on.  Now, people can have lower-case windows, but not upper-case Windows&trade;.  And now, Microsoft&trade;, you can have an application store, but not an App Store&trade;.
