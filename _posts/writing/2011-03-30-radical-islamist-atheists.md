Oh Lord.  

Wait, can I say "Lord", Newt?

In a [recent speech](http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/03/28/gingrich-fears-atheist-country-dominated-by-radical-islamists/), our former Speaker of the House and future former Republican presidential candidate said this:<!-- more -->

 > I am convinced that if we do not decisively win the struggle over the nature of America, by the time they're my age they will be in a secular atheist country, potentially one dominated by radical Islamists and with no understanding of what it once meant to be an American.

First, [secular](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/secular)
    
 > Not pertaining to or connected with religion


Now, [atheist](href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/atheist)

 > A person who denied or disbelieves the existance of a supreme being or beings.

Seems to me, "radical Islamists" are neither "secular" or "atheist".  Maybe Mr. Gingrich should check the Google before he speaks.
