I use Apple’s Photos and iCloud for my main photo library, but I have [Dropbox’s][1] [auto-upload][2] turned on as a poor-man's backup, and I’m a big fan of [Google Photos][3]

Google Photos has search down pat.  I can type in `Jimmy dog` and get all the images and videos of me and my dog.  I can type in `train` and see all the pictures of trains I’ve taken. The “train” search will even show me pictures of people on a train, or standing next to train tracks.  It’s pretty incredible.

<!-- more -->

Google also does the logical thing with your [Live Photos][4].  It will take your Apple-proprietary Live Photos and make them into easily sharable GIFs with its [Motion Stills][5] app.

Apple needs to catch up on the Photos front.  I appreciate the security of Apple using only on-device logic to identify what’s in my pictures, but devices aren’t smart enough, and _only my_ stuff isn’t enough data.  

Google can recognize the difference between an orange and a basketball because it has millions of examples of each.  Here’s hoping for an opt-in system to let Apple detect objects and faces in the cloud so I can stay in the default Photos app.
