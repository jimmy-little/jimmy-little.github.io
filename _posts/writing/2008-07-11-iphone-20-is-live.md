Anyone who REALLY cares already knows this, but iTunes is pushing the new iPhone 2.0 software finally.  <!-- more --> I've been on the 2.0 software for a couple days now, thanks to a leaked firmware update on <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2008/07/10/iphone-2-0-firmware-5a347-available-early/" target="_blank">MacRumors</a>.
  
So far, so good.  I tapped the shiny blue App Store icon on the home screen, and I've downloaded a few apps from the app store, and it just works.  I've got a few freebies, like the Facebook, MySpace, AIM and New York Times apps.  I also got the <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/applications/omnifocus/" target="_blank">OmniFocus</a> companion program, which I've been waiting for.  I'm a religious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" target="_blank">GTD</a> follower and a long-time OmniFocus user.  Totally worth the $20.

The best free app I've found is Remote, which allows your iPhone to control your iTunes and Apple TV from your WiFi connection.  You see playlists, album art, and can search all on your iPhone screen.  I'll use this every day, I'm sure.

Also added to my home screen is a dedicated Contacts app, so I don't need to go through the phone to get to it.  There's a search function in the Contacts app, finally.  With 3000+ contacts, it took a lot of flicking to scroll through those.  There's also a new calculator with a bunch of buttons I don't understand.

Will I buy the new iPhone 3G?  Not yet.  In New York, I can almost always find a WiFi point, so 3G isn't that important.  I have a GPS for driving directions, and the WiFi/cellular "fake" GPS in the original iPhone is good enough for walking directions.  Someday, there will be a cool killer app that requires geotagging or super-high-speed mobile downloads.  Then, I'll get a 3G iPhone.  For now, I'm happy with the iPhone Classic. I'm just glad I don't have to pay the $20 upgrade fee that iPod Touch users need to cough up.

By the way, I'm copyrighting iPhone Classic.  Somebody write me a check&#8230;
