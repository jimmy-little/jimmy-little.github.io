In the latest public beta of iOS, the TouchID interface changed from a solid white panel that slid up from the bottom to a full screen blurred overlay.

It struck me that this is the same overlay that FaceTime uses when choosing someone to call. 

I’m beginning to think all the rumors about a facial recognition system may be legit. If the “authorize my phone to do this thing” screen looks like FaceTime but works with TouchID, it’s not too much of a stretch to think that “FaceID” could be an option on this screen.

And on top of that, if/when Apple gets the fingerprint sensor working behind a display, putting my thumb on that image in the center of the screen would allow for edge-to-edge screens with no bezels.
