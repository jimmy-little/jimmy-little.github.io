TUAW's headline:

> Microsoft's going to make it pricier to bring your iOS device to work
    
 but, later in the article:
  
  
>It should be noted that the higher price also pertains to Windows phones and laptops and Surface tablets.

I'm not going to link to the story, because I don't link to baited headlines.  
  
The fact is, Microsoft is hurting in the enterprise because of the tremendous number of iPhones, Android phones, and iPads being used in BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) business environments, so they have to raise the licensing fees for Microsoft Sharepoint and Exchange servers on *every* device to compensate.  To imply they're raising prices on iOS in your headline and write they're raising prices on everything in the fourth paragraph is just praying for clicks.
  
Assholes.
