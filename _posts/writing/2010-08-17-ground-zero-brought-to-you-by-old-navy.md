Bob Cesca:

  
> This bears repeating: unlike Park 51, which is blocks away, there's going to be a 55,000 square foot mall <em>under the same ground</em> where people fell to their deaths on that terrible day. Ground that's   mixed with the remains of the dead. A mall.

When you put it that way, protesting a religious institution that is blocks away just seems silly.
