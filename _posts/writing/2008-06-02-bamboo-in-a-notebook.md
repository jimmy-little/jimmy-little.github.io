According to Electronista,  Asus is  rumored to start making laptop and computer cases out of bamboo.  Makes sense, really.  Bamboo is a durable, resiliant material.  It dissipates heat and is easily formed with moisure, heat, and high pressure.  It's also biodegradeable and renewable.  If this works, and Apple catches on, I'd absolutely buy a MacBook Bamboo.
