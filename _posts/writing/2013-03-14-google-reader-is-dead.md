Google announced that they're <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html" target="_blank">killing their Reader</a>.
  
  
For those non-nerds out there, Google Reader is a cool little web app that takes all your RSS feeds and lets you read them.
  
  
  
Wait, you don't know about RSS feeds?  Ugh.  You should read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS" target="_blank">this</a>.  But come back when you're done.
  
  
At first glance, someone who loves Google Reader like me is now clamoring for a new way to collect the articles from all the Web sites I enjoy into one place.  It's HORRIBLE!!
  
  
But then I think about it.  It's NOT horrible at all!  First, I don't like Google all that much.  I don't use gMail for anything other than when I need to sign up for something I know is going to spam the shit out of me.  I try to use Apple's less-than-stellar Maps app so I don't have to run all my location searches through El Goog, who I know logs all of them in a secret file to give the government after I win the lottery and disappear.  Google Docs is a joke, and Google+ gets spammier by the minute.
  
  
Long story short, I'm trying to get away from Google, but Reader was locking me in. It syncs to all my RSS readers, like Byline on my iPad and iPhone.  On any device or any web browser, I can pick up where I left off, because Google Reader syncs everything.  I will miss that.
  
  
But, now I can leave the Google Machine.  I will convert my RSS list into an OPML thingy and import it into Byline.  Other people will have to find their own solution.
  
  
This is a fantastic boon for app developers on all platforms.  Now they will build new and better apps to replace Reader, just as Reader displaced the likes of NetNewsWire and Gator on the desktop years ago.
