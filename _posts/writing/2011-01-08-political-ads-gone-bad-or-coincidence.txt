If you haven't heard, Arizona Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot this morning at a political event.  It is not yet known if she will survive the surgery.  This poster from the Sara Palin political action committee puts Rep. Gabrielle Giffords in the crosshairs.  I'm not at all implying that it is a direct result, but some people tend to take things literally.  
  
Sometimes hyperbole becomes reality.  Images matter.  Words matter.
  
Palin removed the poster from her site hours after the shooting.
