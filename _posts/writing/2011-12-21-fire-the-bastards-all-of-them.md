    The House Republicans walked off the floor today, then pulled the plug on CSPAN in order to avoid a vote on the middle class tax cut set to expire at the end of 2011.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    While John Boehner will not confirm his office was responsible for cutting off the CSPAN feed, according to CSPAN's <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/cspan/status/149514550285312001">Twitter</a> account, "C-SPAN has no control over the U.S. House TV cameras &#8211; the Speaker of the House does."
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Just to recap, here's the timeline of what the House of Representatives did today:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10:00 AM &#8211; House of Representatives begins session
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10:02 AM &#8211; Pledge of Allegiance is recited
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10:03 AM &#8211; Speaker Pro Tempore Michael Fitzpatrick (R-PA) adjourns session for the day over the objections of Democrratic Whip Steny Hoyer. Republicans leave the chamber.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    10:04 AM &#8211; CSPAN feed is cut off.
  </P></p> 
  
  <p>
    So, they were at work for a total of four minutes today solving the overwhelming problems of this country. If they worked at McDonalds and showed up for .8% of their workday, they'd be on the street.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Where they belong.
