Now, I know MSNBC and Fox News are not really "news".  They are both opinion networks that do some news stories.  And, they both run mostly-news during the day and the prime time lineup is completely partisan personality driven punditry.  I get it.  But don't freakin' lie to me.

  <!-- more -->

Hannity, O'Reily, Olbermann, Maddow, and the like each twist the facts to fit their agenda.  I get it.  And I watch it.  I can't just watch one side or the other, I flip.  Olbermann's left-leaning snarkiness is easily overshadowed by Glenn Beckâ€™s right-wing nutjobbery.  I like to stay balanced, so sue me.  And it's freakin' funny!

Also funny is Jon Stewart.  In this clip he points out a slight problem with Hannity's video footage of a recent tea-baggers rally outside the Capitol.  See, the problem is, Hannity tries to pass off a video of a 40,000 plus rally from a couple months ago as the footage from the recent rally, which the Washington Post said had "around 10,000".
