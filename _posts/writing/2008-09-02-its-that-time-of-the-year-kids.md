That's the typical Apple cryptic message.  
10 AM September 9th at the Moscone Center in San Fransisco, there will be another Apple Event, this one presumably about iPods.  I think they'll really push the WiFi capabilities of the iPhone and iPod Touch.  They proved that controlling your computer from your handheld is intriguing, since well over 75% of iPhones and iPod Touches have downloaded the Apple Remote software from the App store.  Look for more expansion on that theme.  My uneducated, redundant, possibly blasphemous predictions after the break
