Tronc stands for "Tribune Online Content", but it sounds more like a piece of Ikea furniture or a respiratory infection.  Also, I'm never going to go out of my way to lowercase the name. It might not (probably won't) save the company in the long term, but it's a move in the right direction.  

Also, this Twitter exchange is pretty funny...
