Every bit of plastic ever created, EVER, is still on the planet?  That's over 100 billion tons of it.  About 15% is recycled, and the rest is in the landfills and oceans.  Even biodegradable plastic takes years to dissolve, and that's under ideal conditions.  Under a landfill or under water, where there is no oxygen or sunlight, the plastic will take millions of years to break down.  MILLIONS.
