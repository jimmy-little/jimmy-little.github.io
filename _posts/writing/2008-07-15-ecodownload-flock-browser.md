Here's why I recommend <a href="http://flock.com/" target="_blank">Flock.</a>

### It's Free
It's free, and it's open source. This means neither Microsoft or Apple have their hands on it. It's based on the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/" target="_blank">Mozilla</a> engine, so it works and acts like Firefox. And, it is almost completely compatible with all your Firefox extensions. 

### It's Social
It's social. I deal with a lot of social stuff on the web. I do the Facebook, I tweet on Twitter, and I Digg websites, and bookmark with Delicious. I upload photos to Flickr, Stumble Upon, and i even occasionally Pownce. All of these services are built into flock. I can sign into the sidebar and see what all my friends are up to, without hitting a dozen web pages. It's quick and efficient. It also loads my RSS feeds from Google Reader into the sidebar, so I can read all my feeds, without ever leaving Flock. (Check me out on the social web&#8230; just read the sidebar on the right>>>>)

### It's Extensible
Since Flock is open source, it can be built upon. <a href="http://browser.flock.com/eco/" target="_blank">Flock Eco Edition</a> is Flock, with all the social goodness, and more. It adds relevant RSS feeds, Flickr feeds, YouTube feeds, and a bamboo-inspired theme. You can see articles from all over the web about things that interest you, as an eco-geek. You can see YouTube videos about sustainable architecture, right next to someone's Flickr feed from the last Green Building conference.
  
Flock is not for everyone. You can sort of get lost in here for hours clicking around, reading articles, and looking at pictures and video from around the world. I tend to find the best stuff in no time with Flock, because everything is social-network based. The best stuff rises to the top naturally, because that is what other people have been reading and ranking. Even if you don't participate in the ranking and tagging of stuff on the web, Flock allows you to benefit from the millions of others doing it.
