2015 is gone.  2016 is here. 

There are a lot of posts about the new year floating around the internet this week.  I've never been a "resolution" kind of guy.  

Don't wait until the "new" year.  January 1 is just another day in your life.  If you want to do something positive, DO IT IMMEDIATELY.  

Me, from 2011:
