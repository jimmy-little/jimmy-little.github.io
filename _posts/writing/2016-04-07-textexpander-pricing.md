This post has been [UPDATED][1]

First, let me say I LOVE TextExpander. I've been using it for years, every day. On my 8 month old laptop, I've expanded snippets over 8500 times, saving 34 hours of typing.

Smile Software posted [on their blog][2] that they were changing the pricing model for TextExpander. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I do know that I will have to seriously consider whether I'm going to switch to the new model.

From the Smile Blog:

> TextExpander is US $4.95 per month for individuals on the Life Hacker plan. Current TextExpander users receive a 50% loyalty discount for their first year. 

### History
I searched my email archive and found my receipts for TextExpander. The first version I bought was 1.3 in 2006. I must have gotten a deal, because it was only $20. I upgraded (paid $35) to 3.0 with OS X 10.6. For the big 4.0 update, I bought the new version in the Mac App Store. That was $45. Then a $20 upgrade to 5.0 last year, which took it back out of the Mac App Store. 

In total, I've spent $120 to use TextExpander for 10 years. That's a damn good _value_. Works out to about a buck a month, and that's certainly worth it.

The new model will cost me $5 per month. In the same 10 years, I would have spent $600 on TextExpander. Is that a good _value_? I'd say no. 

Smile will keep the lights on "through El Capitain and the next version of OS X" for current users, but after that, who knows what will happen...

### On the Mac
I don't need or want all the collaboration features of the forthcoming [textexpander.com][3] service. I want to keep my snippets in Dropbox and call it a day. I'd happily pay $20 a year for a TextExpander subscription without all the collaboration features. Without a reasonable option, I will either migrate my snippets to [Keyboard Maestro][4], or check out another expansion utility like [TypeIt4Me][5] or [Typinator][6]

### On iOS
I find myself rarely using TextExpander on my iOS devices anymore. I keep regular snippets in the stock Keyboard settings, because the TextExpander Touch keyboard is virtually unusable. Most apps that I use that sync snippets with TextExpander Touch have their own snippet libraries ([Drafts][7], [Editorial][8]), and I'm using [Copied][9] to keep longer blocks of text at the ready. 

On top of my dwindling use of [TextExpander Touch][10], the iOS app doesn't seem to background sync, so every time I add a snippet on my Mac, I have to open the iOS app and force a sync. AND, there is still not an iPad Pro-optimized version of the app five months later. 

### My Future With TextExpander
I will spend the next few months exporing alternatives, and hoping Smile comes up with a more realistic pricing structure. If, by the end of the "next version of OS X", the pricing structure doesn't get more realistic, I'll move away from TextExpander. 
<a href name="UPDATE"></a>
Photoshop and Microsoft Office are each $10 per month, and I don't think TextExpander is even close to 50% of the value or complexity of those apps. I'm hoping Smile adjusts this soon.

# UPDATE

---

Today, [TextExpander][11] has listened to long time customers, and have adjusted.

> We will apply a lifetime discount of 50% off the Life Hacker pricing to customers of any past version of TextExpander. That amounts to just US $20 per year. In our initial rollout, we offered the discount for the first year only, and that was a mistake. We value our long-term customers, and itâ€™s important for us to demonstrate that in our actions. Thanks for bearing with us as we sorted this out.

So, it looks like I'll be staying on the TE bandwagon.  I am so happy about this, because I was not looking forward to moving 600+ snippets to another utility.  $20 a year is reasonable and sustainable for both the customers and the developers.

Strong work, Smile.
