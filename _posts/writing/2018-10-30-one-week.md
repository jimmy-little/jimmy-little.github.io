Just a quick reminder that there's just one week to election day! 

I mailed in my ballot today, and that's where I got that sweet sticker. I'll proudly wear it next Tuesday.

If you haven't yet, make sure you're properly registered in your state. [Vote.org](https://www.vote.org/am-i-registered-to-vote/) has a great tool to verify. It takes less than a minute.

If you've been bumped off the rolls (don't get me started!), most states allow you to cast a provisional ballot on Election Day. 

Get out there and change the world! Or not! Vote however you want.
