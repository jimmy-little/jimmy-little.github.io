[Drafts](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-4-quickly-capture-notes/id905337691?mt=8&at=1001l3C5) is an app I use every day.  On iOS, it's where text starts for me.

Lately, I've been trying out the Apple Watch app.  I added the Drafts complication to my Watch face.  Now, when something occurs to me, here's what I do:

 1. Tap the complication on my watch face
 2. Drafts loads directly into dictation mode
 3. Say some stuff
 4. Hit Done.
    
That's it. I have a new text note sitting in my Drafts, and I never touched my phone.

Pretty sweet.  Now, if Drafts would just sync with Dropbox...
