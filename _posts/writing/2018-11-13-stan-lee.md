Stan Lee passed away at 95. He was a WWII veteran and an American icon. Fitting that he decided to check out on Veterans Day, I guess. As someone who works for Disney (which owns Marvel), it was all over our email and Slack yesterday. It was also all over nerd-Twitter. And deservedly so.

Stan Lee was one of the most forward thinking people in entertainment. He introduced diversity into comic books back when having a black or Indian hero was unheard of. His heroes all had real lives and stories well beyond their "hero" personas.

I was never much of a comic book (ahem, _graphic novel_) kind of guy, but I love me some superhero movies. Marvel makes the best movies in that genre, hands down. I enjoy the DC stuff, but it's way too moody and dark for me. Marvel movies (even **Infinity War**) always leave the viewer with some hope for the future.

Stan Lee's hope for the future can probably best be seen in [this comic he wrote for _The Atlantic_ in 2007][1].
