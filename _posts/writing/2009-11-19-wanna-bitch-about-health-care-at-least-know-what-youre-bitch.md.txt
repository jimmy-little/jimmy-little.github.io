The full text of the November 18, 2009 version of the Senate Health Care Bill is online now.  I'm going to read it, are you?
  
[Senate Health Care Bill][1] (link to pdf)  Officially called "H.R. 3590, The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"
  
The one thing I immediately notice is that it's not a new bill, it's an amendment to an unrelated bill about first time homebuyers that are federal employees.  This is because a bill cannot start in the Senate, it starts in the House.  You can only propose amendments in the Senate, so Senators regularly amend unrelated bills so they can start debate on the issue while the House is still debating. 
  
If you're interested in how a bill goes through the process, enjoy this video.
