I wrote a lot  more than I  usually do this week in the lead-up to WWDC.  Here are all the posts all on one page.

I didn't even have time to write about Swift 3, watchOS3, the disaster that is iTunes, Apple's status on cloud services, and a bunch of other stuff. I'll get to that after WWDC, because I think we're going to see a lot about all of those things.
