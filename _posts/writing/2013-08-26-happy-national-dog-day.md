[August 26 is](http://www.nationaldogday.com) National Dog Day.

It's no secret I'm a dog guy, and not too keen on cats.  If you're a cat person, good on ya'.  [There's a day for you, too](http://www.nationalcatday.com). 

I have a 10 year old Boston Terrier named Isabelle, AKA the Bug Dog.  She's so cool I named my company, [Bug Dog Studios](http://www.bugdogstudios.com), after her.   

Appreciate your dog today, and everyday.  Because dogs are awesome.

Woof.
