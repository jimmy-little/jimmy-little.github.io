Over 25 billion (with a B) plastic water bottles are tossed away each year?&nbsp; It requires about 1.5 million barrells of oil to produce these bottles, and at todays prices, that's over $1,665,000,000 in crude.&nbsp; Ditch the single serve bottles and opt for a water cooler.&nbsp; Its cheaper, and since those 5 gallon jugs get sanitized and reused, it's greener.&nbsp; Better yet, break out the Brita.&nbsp; Filtering your own water saves even more green.&nbsp; Just make sure to use a stainless steel or Nalgene water bottle for those refills; regular plastic bottles can harbor bacteria that could make you sick.
