It‚Äôs November, so it‚Äôs time to talk about my social media habits again. I did this in [2016][1], [2012][2]. and [2010][3].

Here‚Äôs the 2017 edition:
* Still using [Tweetbot][4]. It works with my brain and is always rock-solid.
* [Twitter][5] is here for ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Twitter stuff like polls. Still don‚Äôt really like the app.
* I keep a home screen shortcut to Facebook.com. I deleted the Facebook app a while ago because I don‚Äôt like the thought of Facebook hooks into my location, photos, etc. Using it in Mobile Safari with content blockers enabled works just fine and allows me to avoid cross-site ads, location trackers, and other creepy things.
* [Pinterest][6] is there to look at fancy furniture I want to build, and we used it a _lot_ planning the wedding.
* [Instagram][7] is hanging around. Trying again (for the 23,894th time) to get into Instagram.
* [Snapchat][8] is still there, but I realized I haven‚Äôt logged in and can‚Äôt remember my password.
* [LinkedIn][9] because I work in corporate America.

So there you have it. I still consider these time wasters, hence the ‚è∞üöΩ folder title.  I am happy that I‚Äôm a lot more streamlined in my social media usage these days. I no longer auto-post tweets to Facebook. I do crosspost Instagram to Facebook, but my Twitter audience is ay different than my Facebook friends list, so mixing those conversations became toxic at times.  Ignore the second screen of this folder - it‚Äôs full of games.
