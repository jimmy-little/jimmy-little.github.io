OK, listen...

The stuff Elon Musk is doing over at Twitter is bat-shit crazy. He's trying a hundred things a day, and they're all failing miserably.

I don't think Twitter is going away any time soon, and I have no plans on leaving (yet). If things go to fuck-all on Twitter, I'll be on [Mastodon][1].

Funny thing is, I've had a [Mastodon account][2] since 2018. I wonder what was going on at Twitter back then that made me think I may need an alternative.

Anyway, I'll be splitting Twitter time with Mastodon for a while. My _plan_ is to keep political stuff on Twitter, since it's already a shitshow, and keep my Mastodon nice and light with only positive things.
