Happy Birthday iPhone - In June.  Why the early celebration? On March 6th (a week late, I might add), Steve Jobs from Apple had another event. This time, he introduced a roadmap for the iPhone Software Development Kit (SDK). I'm a little disappointed, I must say. Last fall, he promised the SDK would be out in February, and now he comes out the 6th day of March and says the third party apps won't be ready until June.
