  Two and a half minutes of adorable.  A 5 year old's take on brand recognition.  She recognizes what almost every logo is, such as the "Eye" of CBS, but doesn't know what they stand for.

She recognizes, by name, the following brands:

 - Disney
 - Apple
 - GE ("that's where my grandpa works")
 - McDonalds
 - Nike

She recognizes as correct products, but not by name:

 - Pepsi
 - KFC
 - Starbucks
 - BP
 - Mercedes ("on a car, looks like a peace sign!")
 - Panera
 - Xbox ("that's what you use to control the TV at Ryan's house")

My favorite quote:

 > That is a parade elephant

If she only knew...
