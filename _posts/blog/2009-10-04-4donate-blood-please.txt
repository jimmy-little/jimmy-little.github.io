I do what I like to do, and let others do what they believe.  For the record, I'm mostly vegetarian, I recycle, I try to conserve water, and generally try to be respectful to the people and the world around me.

    I also believe that we can all be better people and make the world a better place by doing little things.  Not everybody is going to drive an electric car and take 2 minute showers to conserve water.  Not everyone will, but if some do, good on ya!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Another little thing we can do to make the world better is to donate blood.  I'll be honest, I haven't done it in a while.  It's hard to do when you travel as much as I do, but I'm going to start making time for it.  It takes very little time, about an hour every 6 weeks, and it can save a life.  Or many.

    I donated today. I also signed up for my donor card, which will streamline the process in the future.  The blood I donate will be used for transplant recipients, accident and assault victims, or to replace blood lost during surgery.  I may never need blood, but if I do, I know my blood-bank-mojo is in order, and I feel good about that.

    Use canvas bags, drive less, eat responsibly, donate blood.  These things are easy and make the world a better place.  OK, I'm done now, thanks for reading.  Now back to your regularly scheduled snarkiness.
