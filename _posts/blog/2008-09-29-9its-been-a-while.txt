  <img class="alignleft alignnone size-medium wp-image-270" style="float: left; border: 0; margin: 10px;" title="_picture-1" src="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/453260/5085149/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/_picture-1.png" alt="" width="115" height="57" />I know I haven't posted in a while, there just hasn't been time.  I just finished an Aerial Lab flight workshop for Disney's TARZAN tour that will be going out in December.  I'm also working behind-the-scenes for another television show.  </p> 
  
  <p>
    It's gonna be a busy month, but I'll try to keep things updated.

    For those of you who don't know me personally, I live two lives, really.  One is as a carpenter for several TV shows.  In my other life, I am a stagehand for Broadway tours.  Right now, the two are colliding.  I'm working production for a new Fine Living show, and trying to get Tarzan off the ground, so to speak&#8230;
  </p>

    As far as Tarzan goes, we finished a very successful Aerial Lab last week.  An aerial lab is pretty much what it sounds like.  We're testing flight sequences and equipment for the upcoming tour of Disney's Tarzan.  Oh, I didn't mention that I fly people.  I'm a flyguy.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Yes, a flyguy.   If that sounds like a pretty cool job, you're right.  It is.  I've spent the last week clipping people to a little tiny wire, and hurling them around the stage.  If you want to see what a flyguy does, check out <a href="http://www.theflyguy.com" target="_blank">www.theflyguy.com</a>.  It's the website of Paul Rubin, who is the leading aerial choreographer in New York.

  <p>
    As things progress, I'll post video of me and my crew working backstage, and link to some video of what we do, as it becomes available.  Video of this stuff is pretty sparse, because the actors are Union, and the music is copyrighted.  I'll put up what I can, so you can see what I do half the year.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Stay tuned this fall and into the winter and spring.  I'm traveling with Tarzan as the lead flyguy, and I'll be posting images, video, and blogging about my experiences on the road.  This will be my eleventh tour, so I gotta do something to keep it interesting for me.  Hopefully it will be interesting to you too.
