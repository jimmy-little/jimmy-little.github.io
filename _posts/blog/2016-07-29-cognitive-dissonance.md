Part of a Hugh Hewitt interview with VP nominee Mike Pence, quoted on [Vox](http://www.vox.com/2016/7/29/12324660/mike-pence-trump-obama-name-calling):


>HUGH HEWITT: Now, you’ve been with him a lot. President Obama two nights ago called Donald Trump a demagogue after citing fascism, implying that he’s a fascist demagogue...

>MIKE PENCE: It’s been a privilege for me and my family to be able to spend time with Donald Trump, and Melania and their kids, and I just have to tell you, you know, the man that I see when the klieg lights are off, you know, is, he is solicitous, he is bright, he is engaging. And I will say he’s extremely considerate and kind....

>HUGH HEWITT: So you dismiss the demagogue?

>MIKE PENCE But I’ve found him to be, well, you know, **I don’t think name-calling has any place in public life**, and I thought that was unfortunate that the president of the United States would use a term like that, let alone laced into a sentence like that. But I just don’t see it. I see, I think what I have found in Donald Trump is this is a man of enormous accomplishment, obviously someone who has achieved great things in his life.
