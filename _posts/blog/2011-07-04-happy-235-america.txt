    It was 85,831 days ago today when the Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence and announced that the colonies were no longer going to be a part of the British Empire.  And Larry King was born.  I think.

    I'm not a super-patriotic person.  I don't know all the presidents and I don't know when New York, or my home state of Virginia, became states (or commonwealths).  I do know about <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0611/Paul_Revere_redux.html?showall" target="_blank">Paul Revere's Ride</a> and who the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/28/michele-bachmann-john-quincy-adams_n_885868.html" target="_blank">Founding Fathers</a> were, so I guess I could be president.  But I don't want to be.  Seems like a lot of work.

    Independence Day is probably my favorite holiday.  I love Christmas and Thanksgiving because I can go see family.  I like any day that gives me a day off work.  But Independence Day is special.

    Independence Day is the one non-religious holiday that is worth it.  Some are too generic (Labor Day) and some are too specific (Washington's Birthday).  Some are just there to celebrate ethnic groups (Columbus Day, Martin Luther King Day, St. Patricks Day, Cinco de Mayo) and some are just made up to sell stuff (Valentines Day, Mothers Day, Fathers Day).

    Independence Day is the one day you can just BE.  You don't have to get anyone gifts, there's no obligation to travel to see family, there's no expectation of solemnity or surprise.  It's just a day to enjoy being American.  Enjoy your freedom to grill, watch baseball, or play Ultimate Frisbee in the park.  OK, don't do the Ultimate Frisbee thing.  It's kind of douche-y and you are never as good as you think you are.  And missed Frisbees always seem to spill my wine.

    Happy Independence Day.  Go have some fun.
