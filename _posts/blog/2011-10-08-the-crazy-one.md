 > Here&rsquo;s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes.<br />The ones who see things differently. They&rsquo;re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them.<br />About the only thing you can&rsquo;t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They invent. They imagine. They heal. They explore. They create. They inspire. They push the human race forward.<br />Maybe they have to be crazy.<br />How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that&rsquo;s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels?<br />We make tools for these kinds of people.<br />While some see them as the crazy ones, we see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

Steve Jobs died this week. I'm not going to get all touchy-feely sad about it. I never met the man. But the world lost an innovator who changed the way we do things.

We use a computer mouse because of him. Hell, we probably use a computer because of him. We buy music online because of him. We carry that music around in our pockets because of him. We touch, swipe, pinch, and zoom because of him. We enjoy amazingly lifelike animated movies because of him. We create wonderful works of literature, art, and goofy fun on pencil thin slabs of glass because of him.

Whether you use Macs, iPods, iPads and iPhones or not, you can bet whatever you are typing on or listening to, it was influenced by Steve Jobs.

Thanks, Mr. Jobs.
