Hurricane Matthew just swept the East Coast, and the Red Cross is doing what it does. 

Apple has been working with the [Red Cross](https://www.charitywatch.org/ratings-and-metrics/american-red-cross/360) to accept donations for years, and this is no different. As always, it's easy and 100% of your donation goes straight to the Red Cross. No App Store cuts or credit card fees are kept by Apple.
