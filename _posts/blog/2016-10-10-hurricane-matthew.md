Apple, as they regularly do after disasters, has again teamed with the Red Cross to facilitate collecting donations. 

If you have a few bucks laying around, or an iTunes gift card you're not using, consider [donating.](https://buy.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZFinance.woa/wa/buyCharityGiftWizard?&mt=6)

Every bit helps, and the Red Cross is a pretty solid charity.
