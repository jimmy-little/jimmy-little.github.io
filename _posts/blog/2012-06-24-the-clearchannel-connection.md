You know what's weird? Squids. You know what else is weird? This: 

ClearChannel plays to 190 million listeners around the country. That's more than half of Americans. More Conservative talk radio stations are run by ClearChannel than not. 

Mitt Romney's old company Bain Capital [owns][2] ClearChannel Communications. 

[Rush Limbaugh][3] works for ClearChannel. 

[Sean Hannity][4] works for ClearChannel 

[Glenn Beck][5] works for Premiere Radio Network, owned by ClearChannel. 

ClearChannel and Premiere Radio are known for hiring actors to call into shows to give the hosts a starting point for the conversation that host wants to have. From ClearChannel's [Wikipedia][6] Page: 

> Clear Channel, through its subsidiary, Premiere Radio Networks, auditions and hires actors to call in to talk radio shows and pose as listeners in order to provide shows, carried by Clear Channel and other broadcasters, with planned content in the form of stories and opinions. 

Odd. Maybe that's why all these "Reagan Republican" talk show hosts are agreeing with Romney, who is [very][7] [much][8] [unlike][9] [Reagan][10]. 

Is it that these guys really hate Obama, or is it that they want to keep the old bosses happy? I'd guess a little of both. 

To be fair, I tried to find some connections between ClearChannel's liberal hosts and Obama. Other than mostly undeserved blind idealogical devotion, I didn't see any.
