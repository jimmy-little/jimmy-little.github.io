  I just found an old Tumblr post of mine from two years ago.  It's a screenshot of my social apps from November 2010.

  Do you believe I actually used Google Buzz?  Remember that?  Also in the dustbin are 12mail, which posted 12 second videos to Twitter; and Gowalla, a social network that went nowhere.  iOS's Push Notification system has replaced Boxcar entirely, and I never really used Bump or IM+.  Instagram, Facebook, and Foursquare are still there for me, but Tweetbot has totally replaced Twitter's crappy app.  
  
  For reference, here is my current social folder:

  I absolutely LOVE Tweetbot and Netbot.  Facebook is there because I am forced to use it.  I still don't like Facebook all that much, but it seems a necessary evil.  I just logged into Instagram again after months of inactivity.  You'll notice the shitty Instagram filter on the first screenshot.  I try not to do that anymore.  I feel like people are going to be really mad in a few years when all of their pictures look like they were taken on a toy camera.

  Google+ is there for some reason, and What's App and Google Voice only get used for very specific purposes.  I am all over Foursquare lately, and Glympse is incredible for letting people know when you're arriving. 

  So there it is.  Because you didn't ask.
