### SUPPORTING APPLE THROUGH AMICUS BRIEFS:

As listed on a [Press Info](http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2016/03/03Amicus-Briefs-in-Support-of-Apple.html#labnol) page on Apple's site, Amicus Briefs supporting Apple's stance on this issue. 

In no particular order, these companies and groups are in support of Apple's stance of not creating software to bypass security for government use.

Seems like Apple's in good company, here.

This, coupled with the FBI's disastrous (in my opinion) showing in the [congressional hearings](http://www.c-span.org/video/?405442-1/hearing-encryption-federal-investigations), make it seem like privacy may actually win this fight.

  * Box

  * Slack
  * Cisco
