  <p>
    Everyone who watches the news knows who Steve Jobs is.  Co-founder of Apple, owns Pixar, and is currently not doing so well, health wise.  There is another Steve to talk about, though.  Steve Wozniak, the OTHER co-founder of Apple.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Steve Wozniak (a.k.a. The Woz) was the brains behind the hardware of the first Apple computer.  Many people attribute Woz with actually inventing the personal home computer.  Woz built it, Jobs marketed it.  Woz went on to consult for other companies, all the while collecting an Apple paycheck.  He formed a company called CL9, where he invented the first Universal Remote Control.  He went on to form a tech company called Wheels of Zeus (a play on WoZ), which was short lived.  He is now on the board for <a href="http://axiotron.com/" target="_blank">Axiotron</a>, a company that takes Macbooks and rips them apart to make "Modbook" touch-screen tablets out of them.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And he plays Nerd Polo.  It's not really called that, technically it's Polo played on Segway personal scooters instead of horses.  Woz is the big guy in the blue up in the picture there&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Why the sudden interest in Woz?  Well, marketing, of course.  When Woz attended the Grammy's a couple years ago, he took self-proclaimed D-list diva <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Griffin" target="_blank">Kathy Griffin</a>, with whom he conspired to fake a relationship to get them both back in the news cycles.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now, he's dancing.  ABC announced today that Woz would join the cast of <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancingwiththestars/index?pn=index" target="_blank">Dancing With The Stars</a>, including Steve-O from Jackass, Jewel and her snaggletooth, Belinda Carlisle and her Botox, the chick from Entertainment Tonight (I think) and some football player, I'm sure.  There are also some other people I've never heard of, which gives me hope that maybe next season you'll see me passe-double-ing my way into obscurity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    At first, I was surprised to see someone like Woz up there.  He's a geek celebrity, not a regular person celebrity.  I know who he is.  People on Twitter know who he is.  Nerds know who he is.  My mom does <em>not</em> know who he is.  Then it hit me:  THAT'S WHY HE'S ON!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    See, ABC made a brilliant move.  The new media way of life is taking over pop culture now.  Obama is on Facebook and Twitter. He does e-mail and texting and all that other stuff.  Right now, I'm watching the Grammy's on CBS, and they're saying "Facebook" and "Twitter" every time they go to commercial.  Regular people are starting to use what was once reserved for nerd-dom.  I have aunts with Facebook accounts.  I have a boss who Twitters.  (As do I. follow me at <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jimmylittle" target="_blank">twitter.com/jimmylittle</a>!)  ABC will be all over the internet, and geeks and nerds all over the country will start watching some ex-football player dance so they can catch a glimpse of Woz throw a tiny, attractive lady around the dance floor for a few minutes.  Then, they'll Twitter about it.  And blog on it.  And put up little YouTube tributes.  It's a viral marketing campaign waiting to happen.  Brilliant. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    And, I predict Woz will make it a good way through the competition.  Voting is by web and text.  Geeks can write a quick AppleScript that will continually vote, close Safari, clear cookies, open Safari, vote, close Safari, clear cookies&#8230;  you get the idea.  He'll stay in there because people who know computers know how to cheat the system, and will do it.  I won't of course, but "people" will.  I'm honest, mostly.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's ironic, really.  Woz left Apple to do new things and (rumor has it) not work with Steve Jobs anymore.  Now, he's on ABC, which is owned by Disney, who has contracts with Pixar, that is run by Steve Jobs, who is the largest stockholder of Disney, that owns ABC.  So, Woz is working with Jobs again, in a weird way&#8230;

    So, all you Dancing With The Stars fans out there, sign up for Twitter, get a Facebook page, start a blog, or strap a webcam to your forehead.  Get ready for geekstream to go mainstream.
