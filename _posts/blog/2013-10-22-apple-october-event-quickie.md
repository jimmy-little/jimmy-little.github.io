## New iPads (duh). 

iPad 5th generation with A7X chip and new body to match iPad mini.   The jury is still out on whether Touch ID will be in the new iPads, but if it is included, it will probably be only on the big-daddy iPad, because it requires the A7 processor.

New iPad mini with Retina display (hopefully) .  Updated to A6 chip (currently on the A5).  

Current iPad mini will be kept on as a low cost option.  Maybe $249?

There's also some chatter about an iPad Smart Cover with keyboard (a la Microsoft Surface Touch Cover) .  We'll have to wait and see about that one.

## Mac Pro

New Mac Pro date and price announced.  I'm guessing starting at $2799 and shippingin November.  If you're lucky. 

## MacBooks

MacBooks will probably be updated to the new Haswell chips from Intel.  There have been rumors of a 12&#8243; MacBook Retina, but that's probably next year.  If it does come out this week, it may be my next MacBook.  I currently use (and LOVE) a 2012 MacBook Air 11&#8243;, and love the super-portable size, but an extra inch of screen couldn't hurt.  

## Software

New versions of iWork and iLife.  Numbers, Pages, Keynote, iPhoto, iMovie and GarageBand are butt-ugly when compared to iOS 7 and need help. There have also been screenshots of new icons, so it's pretty much a given.  Garage Band will be going free with In-App Purchase. It's the lone holdout of iLife and iWork that wasn't free because the loops included cost licensing fees. Now, the basic app will be free, and you can pay separately for loops and extra instruments.

OSX Mavericks should ship this week also, with an iOS 7 update to match AirDrop and iCloud magic in Mavericks. 

There's big hope for a new AppleTV and a wearable something in the watch-ish category, but I'd be really surprised if that happens.  New software on the AppleTV would be freakin' awesome, though.  Let's get some apps on that little black box! 

There's probably a bunch more, but I'm typing this on my phone on the subway.  I'm setting it to auto-post, so hopefully it will be up before the event this afternoon. 

I'll be taking a long lunch to watch.  Because I'm a giant nerd.
