  <img src="images/articles/didyouknow.png" alt="did you know" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="150" height="53" align="left" />that putting electronic equipment like DVD players, VCR's, game consoles, and even coffee makers and toasters on a separate power strip can save hundreds of dollars a year on your power bill?</p>

    Most electronics suck power 24/7.  They're called power vampires. If you add a "green switch" to your appliance garage or entertainment center to cut power to things your not using, you can save power.  That saves the planet and your money.  Be sure to leave your Tivo on, though.  Don't want to miss the next episode of House or Don't Sweat It, right?
