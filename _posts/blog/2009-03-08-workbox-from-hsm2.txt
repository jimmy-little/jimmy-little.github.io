  I get a lot of questions about touring. I'm going to write a much longer post about that in the near future, but for now, here's a glimpse at my latest workbox.</p> 
  
  <p>
    For a guy (or gal) on the road, your workbox is like your little mini home.  You keep tools in there, but that's just the start.  I, for one, keep dog stuff, some electronics, Guitar Hero, and some books.  It's really necessary, especially given the seriously restrictive and oppressive limits imposed by the airlines these days&#8230;

    More on "the road" later!
