A green switch can save HUNDREDS of dollars a year on your electric bill?  Most equipment, including TV's, DVR's, DVD players, VCR's, amps, and even microwaves and coffee makers suck power 24/7.  They're called Vampires for a reason.  If you add a green switch to your entertainment center, to turn off everything but your DVR (digital video recorder, or TiVo), you can save a ton of money, and a ton of pollution, each year.  It can be as simple as a separate power strip for the stuff you leave on and the stuff you turn off.  Leave that DVR on, though.  It won't record without power.  Baby steps, people.  Baby steps.
