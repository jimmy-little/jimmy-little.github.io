Microsoft, in a [complaint][1] to the Justice Department, says that governments shouldn't be able to keep cloud providers behind a gag order when they execute a search warrant. 

> Microsoft brings this case because its customers have a right to know when the government obtains a warrant to read their emails, and because Microsoft has a right to tell them.

Damn straight, Microsoft.
