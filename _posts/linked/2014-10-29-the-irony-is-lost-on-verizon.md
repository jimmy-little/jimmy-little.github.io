Writing for the Verizon-owned [SugarString][1] "news" site, Nick Douglas begins:

> Hungary’s parliament is considering a bill that would impose a tax on internet use, a hefty 150 forints (US $0.62) per gigabyte. And the internet is pissed.

and concludes:

> An internet traffic tax is an innovation tax, and any such tax, no matter how small, would be philosophically devastating.

I totally agree.  My issue comes from the fact that Douglas rails against the constantly increasing price of internet access while collecting a paycheck from the biggest culprit of arbitrary internet price increases in the US.  I'm surprised they [didn't ban][2] this story, too.
