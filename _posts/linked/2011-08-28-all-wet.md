Jeff Jarvis, on his brilliant [BuzzMachine](http://www.buzzmachine.com/2011/08/27/how-we-could-cover-storms/) blog:

>But mostly, shouldn&rsquo;t reporters report? Standing in the water repeating what we already know over and over is not reporting. Reporting would be finding out what government is not doing &mdash; see Katrina. But in truth, with all this information flying by, we don&rsquo;t need a lot of reporting unless and until government messes up. That&rsquo;s what is making journalism more efficient and sustainable.

Just a bunch of idiots getting wet.
