Elon Musk, on the Tesla Blog:

>I should add a note here to explain why Tesla is deploying partial autonomy now, rather than waiting until some point in the future. The most important reason is that, when used correctly, it is already significantly safer than a person driving by themselves and it would therefore be morally reprehensible to delay release simply for fear of bad press or some mercantile calculation of legal liability.

In addition to safety, he touches on battery, solar, trucks, ride sharing, and more. 

Real life Tony Stark.
