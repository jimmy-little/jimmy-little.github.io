Alan Taylor at [The Atlantic][atl] put together a bunch of photos from the opening days of Disneyland back in 1955.

Some things I find interesting:
 - In the photo above, a character is photographed without their head. This would never happen these days.
 - The faces on the masks are absolutely terrifying
 - Disneyland was _small_.
 - Disneyland's opening was very, uhhhh... white.
 
 So much has changed.
