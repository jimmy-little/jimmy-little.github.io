UPDATE: And as if on cue, the [story comes out](http://www.wsj.com/articles/justice-department-seeks-to-force-apple-to-extract-data-from-about-12-other-iphones-1456202213?mod=trending_now_4) today (24 hours after this post) that the FBI has a pile of phones awaiting this decision.  *Bullshit, indeed.*
