Constitution Hall in Washington D.C.  His office says<br /> 
  
> The speech will offer a new way of thinking about our energy production and consumption and a new sense of what is possible when we choose to work together. It will propose a means of tapping America's innovative skills to build a more secure energy future.\</p\\\>
  
Apparently, Mr. Gore will lay out an "unprecedented challenge" to the American people on energy and climate change.  I'm listening.
