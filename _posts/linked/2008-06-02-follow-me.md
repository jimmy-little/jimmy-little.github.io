What is twitter?  Twitter is a service for people to connect using short, 140 character messages.  Sending a twitter message (a "tweet") can be done from the web, a twitter desktop application, or through a mobile phone.  I'm tweeting from my iPhone a couple times a day.  If you're a trusted friend, you'll get all my tweets.  Other people will get public messages, and notes about cool and interesting tools, gadgets, and products I see throughout the day.  Join twitter.  You follow me, I'll follow you.  It's like talking, without all the awkward silences.
