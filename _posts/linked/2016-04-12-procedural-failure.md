Over at [MacStories][1], Graham Spencer wraps up a piece saying:

> It is too soon to say, but Apple's actions today may well be the latest example of policy and procedural failure on App Review. 

This seems to be a running theme over the last couple years.  The App Store(s) and the review process are both stuck in 2008, while developers and customers are living in 2016.

I'm hoping for big app review and App Store related changes in iOS 10 and macOS come WWDC.
