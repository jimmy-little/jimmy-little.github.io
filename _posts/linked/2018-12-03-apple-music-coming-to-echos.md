From the [Amazon Blog](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/devices/alexa-play-bebe-rexha-on-apple-music):

 > Music has always been one of Alexa’s most popular features and today we’re excited to announce that Apple Music will be available on Echo devices beginning the week of December 17.

Very nice. It's fun to see Apple Music branching out to more platforms, especially considering they have the HomePod smart speakers.  Apple Music has been on iOS and Android since the beginning. Now on to the Amazon Echo platform.

It'll be interesting to see if Apple keeps pushing further out. Their services revenue is where they are seeing the most growth, so putting the services on a wider array of hardware may be the direction they're heading.
