[Fast Company](http://www.fastcodesign.com/3028971/whats-the-difference-between-a-font-and-a-typeface) explains it well. 

> Even type experts agree: Typeface and font can be used interchangeably at this point. But if you come across an annoying pedant who cares deeply about maintaining the distinction for the masses, just remember this: The difference between a font and a typeface is the same as that between songs and an album. The former makes up the latter. Remember that and you're good to go.

Not that it matters to most people, but for us font nerds it's important. I guess I'm one of those annoying pedants.
