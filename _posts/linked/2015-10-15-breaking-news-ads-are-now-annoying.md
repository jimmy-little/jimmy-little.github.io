Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) SVP Scott Cunningham has [released a statement][1] regarding the current state of online ads:

>As technologist, tasked with delivering content and services to users, we lost track of the user experience

He goes on:

>Looking back now, our scraping of dimes may have cost us dollars in consumer loyalty.

I have two reactions to this.  

1. _No shit_.

2. It's good that the ad industry is finally catching up to user expectation.  Nerds have been using ad blockers on desktop browsers for a while, and with iOS9, we're all adding content blockers to our mobile devices.

I don't hate "ads", I hate the junk that quadruples [page loads][2], [slows down][3] the [open web][4], and tracks me around the internet. These are not just ads.  They are Facebook/Twitter buttons, pop-over "shade" ads that cover all of the content, cross-network trackers, and other nefarious junk eating up my valuable mobile data.
