while at the same time, telling automakers 

> The FBI and NHTSA are warning the general public and manufacturers – of vehicles, vehicle components, and aftermarket devices – to maintain awareness of potential issues and cybersecurity threats related to connected vehicle technologies in modern vehicles  
  
So, again, the FBI's argument is "make it secure, but leave opportunities for ***us*** to get in."
