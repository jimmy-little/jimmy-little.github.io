Paul Thorrott, on his <a href="http://http://winsupersite.com/windows-8/what-i-ve-learned-dual-booting-blue">Supersite for Windows</a>:
  
>I’ve often described Windows 8 as Windows 7++, because — and contrary to a peculiarly widespread belief — it’s really just a combination of everything that’s great about Windows 7 plus a ton of new desktop improvements, all tied to a new mobile OS I still call Metro. On that note, Blue is Windows 8++: It’s Windows 8 plus a ton of improvements

So, if we're doing the math correctly, Windows Blue is just Windows 7++++. Or is it Windows 7+<sup>16</sup>?  I don't know if we add or multiply made up modifiers.
