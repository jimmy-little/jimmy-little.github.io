I'm not a big fan of Business Insider, but there are some good quotes and links in this story.


>Most in the technology community rallied around Apple at the time, arguing that weakened encryption might help government investigators, but it would also make customers vulnerable to hackers.

>Now, with a massive top-secret archive of some of the NSA's own exploits having been leaked online, it appears they were right.
