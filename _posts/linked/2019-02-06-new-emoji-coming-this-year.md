 > In the sixth major emoji update since 2014, much of the low hanging fruit has been addressed prior to this release. Skin tone support was added to the Unicode Standard in 2015, increased representation of women in 2016, gender inclusive people in 2017 and hair color additions in 2018.

 > 2019 expands the scope of people that can be represented, including people with various disabilities (proposed by Apple last year), a gender inclusive couple, as well emojis which permit a mix of skin tones for people holding hands.

It's great to see all these new inclusive groups represented in Emoji. Same-sex couples, various disabilities, prosthetic appendages, more skin tone options, and gender options for jobs. 

The Unicode Consortium must get thousands of requests every year for new glyphs. Deciding must be a slog. I'm still waiting on my Tiki emoji, but at least I have a Flamingo for now.
