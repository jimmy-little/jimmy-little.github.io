Academy Award winning effects designer Chris Corbold just broke another Guinness record by blowing some stuff up for the new Bond movie, SPECTRE. 

> Taking place in Erfoud, Morocco, the blast had a total yield of 68.47 tonnes of TNT equivalent and was the result of detonating 8,418 litres of kerosene with 33 kg of powder explosives &#8211; and it lasted for over 7.5 seconds.

Boom.
