I love the fact that most manufacturers are standardizing on a 5-6 volt charging current for all those gadgets that require recharging.  I love the fact that USB happens to spew out 5-6 volts.  So, naturally, most of these crazy little devices have a USB option to charge, so it can charge using standard current from your computer or USB wall wart.

Why don't we eliminate the wart?  I looked high and low today for an in-wall USB outlet that would charge my USB-compatible devices (including my Kodak Zi8, iPhone, Jabra headset, Motorola Bluetooth headphones, Kindle, and more) and couldn't find one.  So, I did what any passive-agressive geek blogger would do, and I made a (poorly done) Photoshop mock-up.  So, I present to you -  The BusBoy.  See what I did there?

b**USB**oy.  Ha.  You're welcome.

Seriously, though, why isn't this built yet?  A 120 volt outlet and a built in transformer powering two 5v USB chargers that can easily be wired into a single J-box as a new installation or DIY replacement.  Seems like a no-brainer to me.  If you want to build one and sell it, feel free.  I'll only require a $0.075 licensing fee per unit.  C'mon, seven and a half cents is a bargain for that kind of genius.

## As If On Cue…

Just a day or two after I invent the coolest damn thing I've ever thought of this week, the folks over at [FastMac][1] toss up this page and say it will be available soon. 

That means it doesn't exist yet, so I'll still take credit for it.  If I were a tad more ambitious, you'd get a letter from my attorney.  But I'm not.  Hell, I don't even have an attorney.
 
My version was better, I think.  It fits a standard wall plate, not a custom one with notches on the side.  How is my Punky Brewster outlet cover supposed to fit on this T-shaped monstrosity???

It's OK, FastMac.  I gave the concept away without restriction.  I hope you make a ton of these, and they become standard issue in new construction.  Just give me my seven and a half cents.
