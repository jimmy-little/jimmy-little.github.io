  </p>
  
  <p>
    If I was going to write the Keynote presentation of the "It's Only Rock and Roll But We Like It" event for Apple, here's what I'd do.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Phil Schiller comes out and welcomes everyone. He then shows lots of numbers and slides about how many songs and apps have been sold, how many ds are out there, and he'll then make a snarky comment about a Zune.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Bertrand Serlet comes out and introduces <a href="http://www.boygeniusreport.com/2009/08/08/apple-itunes-9-details-blu-ray-app-organization/" target="_blank">iTunes 9</a>. Social features are dangerously similar to Boxee. Blu-Ray support is announced, and Scott puts up a slide of the entire Blu-Ray licensing agreement to defend Steve Jobs' "bag of hurt" comment and explain it away. He then demos the social features by looking at Steve Jobs list of recently used media. There is lots of John Mayer music and Michael Pollan documentaries.<br />He then introduces <a href="http://www.examiner.com/x-5020-LA-Music-Shopping-Examiner~y2009m7d28-Project-Cocktail-iTunes-goes-all-out-to-make-your-digital-albums-feel-real" target="_blank">Cocktail</a>, a new technology that bundles lossless quality full albums with liner notes, lyrics, music videos and concert footage. He tells the story of "some bands" that choose to not sell individual tracks, and Cocktail is the future of full-album sales. One of those "some bands" is the Beatles. Starting today, every Beatles album is available using Cocktail!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Phil comes back out and talks about how small the Shuffle is. We tried to make it smaller, but it kept falling into the pores of the butcher-block table. So, the next logical step in the development of the Shuffle is to go from a stick of gum with no buttons to no stick of gum at all. The iPod is the headphones, and it has one button. Simple to operate, just click once for play, click and hold for volume up, click and hold and click for volume down, hold, click, hold for next track. Revolutionary, and it works with Nike+. The new un-iPod will come with a fold-out poster that describes all the click-sequences necessary to operate it.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Then, Phil talks about the ubiquity of iPods, and how much people love their iPhone cameras. Up goes a slide showing the iPhone is the most popular camera on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/cameras/" target="_blank">Flickr</a> and YouTube. Then, segues into the new iPod touch with the same camera as the iPhone 3GS, with video, autofocus, and a mic. And a butt-load more capacity, you know, for all those pictures and videos. You'll need that capacity because it's a 5MP camera and shoots 720p video. Eat that, Flip! Oh, and that mic can be used for VoIP, if you don't want to be tied to a cell carrier. Eat that, AT&T!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oh, and by the way, we're adding a camera to the Nano, too! It's amazing. But this camera is requisitely smaller, so no video or focus.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now that we have all these pictures and videos in the iPod, how do we get it out? We're adding WiFi to the entire iPod line. Upload to Flickr, MobileMe and YouTube. Or just e-mail them. Isn't' that great?
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Scott Forstall is up next, and he shows the new Apple TV. The new Apple TV has all the great new social features of iTunes 9, and also a built-in Blu-Ray player, Netflix and Amazon Unboxed streaming, Pandora and LastFM support. It has an iPod dock built into the top, and will sync right from the network! It doesn't come with a remote, though. So you should buy an iPod touch to control it. The software update will be available to all current Apple TV users for $9.99. You're welcome.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Phil comes back now, and says that all this is great, but there's just one more thing to show you. He initiates an iChat video call, and Steve Jobs's giant head pops up on the big screen. The irony of the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OYecfV3ubP8" target="_blank">1984 commercial</a> is lost on them, but they have pleasant conversation. After all, this is Steve's big public return!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    As they talk, we see that Steve is walking around. All of a sudden, he wanders on stage. He's holding a strange aluminum block that looks like a 1/2&#8243; thick LCD screen. It's the <a href="http://news.digitaltrends.com/talk-back/314/apple-s-ipad-tablet-could-slay-smartphones-ebooks-and-netbooks" target="_blank">iPad</a>!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Steve then breaks into his big comeback keynote extolling the virtues of touch computing while simultaneously trashing every netbook out there.<br />He explains that all the innovations in Snow Leopard and iPhone 3.0 have led to this point. He demos that the iPad runs both OS X apps and iPhone apps. Simultaneously! WiFi! Bluetooth! iSight! SD slot! Cocoa Touch interface! 3G Wireless! 12 hour battery life!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    There is much rejoicing!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Silently, David Pogue and Walt Mossberg slip out of the back of the auditorium, fuming that they were not let in on the secret. Gene Munster has an aneurism. Steve Jobs has a triumphant return, once again.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    He then announces that the 3G is a dual-band chip that will work on GSM and CDMA networks, and will be sold unlocked. Use Sprint, or AT&T, or T-Mobile, or Verizon. Use anyone you want, any plan you want. Anywhere in the world. Everyone is thrilled they aren't locked to anyone. (OK, they're really just happy it's not AT&T&hellip;)
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Oh, and it will cost $800. It will change mobile computing like the iPod changed digital music and the iPhone changed mobile phones.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The iPad. A revolution wrapped in a unicorn.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Ringo Starr and Paul McCartney come onstage and play "A Little Help From My Friends" with Julian Lennon and John Mayer.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The End.
  </p>
