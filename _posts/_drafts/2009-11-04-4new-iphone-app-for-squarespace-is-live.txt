    Right now, I'm updating my Squarespace blog from my iPhone. It doesn't sound like much, but it's a welcome improvement over the old email-to-update model some other blogging platforms use for on-the-go updates. <br />Just playing with the app for a minute, there's a new post mechanism, where you can upload multuple photos from the camera, or take pics from within the App. <br />I uploaded 3 photos. One of a Bloody Mary on the plane to Branson, one of my dog in a sleeping bag, and one of my cameraman, David, from the Dear Genevieve show.<br />It also saves drafts locally, including the drafts you've saved on the web. Very handy for updating long posts on the train.

    Now, my wish list. Apparently, there's no way to label or caption pictures yet. This could become an issue as people use SquareSpace as a photoblog platform. Also, there's currently no way to hyperlink text. You can paste links into the post ( <a href="http://www.hgtv.com/dear-genevieve/show/index.html">http://www.hgtv.com/dear-genevieve/show/index.html</a> ), but you can't just make the words "Dear Genevieve" a link. There is also no way to preview a post before publishing it. <br />I'm sure these minor gripes will be worked out in future updates, as the SquareSpace team is very responsive. At least there's now a simple way to update the site on the go!

        After uploading the above images from my iPhone, I had to access my SquareSpace dashboard from the web and resize them.  The iPhone app sends large images.  Hopefully a future update will add a thumbnail option.
