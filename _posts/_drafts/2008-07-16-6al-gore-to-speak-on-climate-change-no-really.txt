Constitution Hall in Washington D.C.  His office says<br /> 
  
  <blockquote>
    The speech will offer a new way of thinking about our energy production and consumption and a new sense of what is possible when we choose to work together. It will propose a means of tapping America's innovative skills to build a more secure energy future.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Apparently, Mr. Gore will lay out an "unprecedented challenge" to the American people on energy and climate change.  I'm listening&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I'll post details as soon as I hear them.
