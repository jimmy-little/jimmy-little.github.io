  <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-289" style="float: left; border: 0; margin: 10px;" title="martiniblank" src="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/453260/5085149/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/martiniblank-300x226.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="226" />It's that time of year again!  It's the holidays and everyone's life gets a little bit crazier.  I'm no exception, I must confess.  There are things to be done, shopping to be shopped, cocktails to be drunk, and parties to attend.  There are travel days, family get-togethers, friendly cocktail hours, and maybe even a little volunteering.  Did I mention the cocktails?</p> 
  
  <p>
    That being said, this will more than likely be it for me for 2008.  It was a good year, I think.  We had a gasoline price roller coaster,  and near-failure of the auto industry that is still not over.  These things may seem like a burden now, but I'm confident that the turmoil of '08 will lead to a more realistic and earth-friendly auto industry in the near future.

    We had an historic presidential election, finally proving that Americans can do the right thing (in my opinion, of course&#8230;)  Hopefully <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php" target="_blank">President Obama</a> will live up to the hype and promises of the last two years and turn this nation around.  Again.  I'm waiting on the millions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green-collar_worker" target="_blank">Green-Collar jobs</a> that were promised in the campaign, Mr. President.

    We're in the middle of a serious economic recession that is hitting everyone hard.  Maybe this will show us the way back to the real essentials of life, and end our rampant consumerism that has been the American way for decades.  Cut back on the gifts, and make up for it with time.  There's nothing more important than spending time with the ones you love.  Besides, where's that Tickle-Me-Elmo now?  Probably in a box in the attic.

     We've seen political scandal, as usual.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer_prostitution_scandal" target="_blank">Eliot Spitzer</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blagojevich" target="_blank">Rod Blagojevich</a> come to mind, but I'm sure there are many more.  We've lost some greats, like Paul Newman, George Carlin, Estelle Getty, Tim Russert and too many more.  On a happier note, we had a successful <a href="http://en.beijing2008.cn/" target="_blank">Olympiad</a> this year, and it looks like this whole Iraq thing may have an end in sight. 
  </p>

    It was a banner year for me as well.  I hit the magic 100 episode mark in my television career, (78 <strong><em>Don't Sweat It</em></strong>s + 18 <strong><em>Town Haul</em></strong>s  + 15 <strong><em>Trading Spaces</em></strong>!)  I also did my 12th Broadway tour this year, traveling with Disney's <strong><em>High School Musical 2</em></strong> for the last couple months.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Now that 2008 is soon over, I'm looking forward to the new year.  We'll have a new leader, a new outlook, and new challenges.  I'm taking the next couple of weeks to get my home in order, starting an organizational tour-de-force to purge and organize my home to make it more functional, healthier, and maybe even a little more attractive.  I have my annual holiday party at my apartment next week, which takes a lot of planning and prep, Then it's back home to Virginia for a few days of family time.

    I'm coming back to New York in 2009 refreshed, recharged, and ready to take on whatever the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_ox" target="_blank">Year of the Ox</a> throws at me.

    Happy Holidays, Merry Christmas, Happy Hanukah, Happy Kwanzaa, Happy Boxing Day, or just plain Happy Day.  And see you next year!
