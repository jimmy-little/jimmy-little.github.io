    Today is Veterans Day.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today is a day to put aside politics.  Whether you agree with the wars we've fought (and are fighting), or you are a fierce anti-war crusader, forget all about it.  At least for today.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Today is a day to honor all of those who've made the sacrifice for our country and our democracy.  Some of these brave people are still with us, some didn't make it home from battle.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    More than likely, I will never go into the armed forces.  I will probably never volunteer, and I'm almost too old for the draft, if it ever comes back.  I can only hope that those who do fight always do so with compassion, strength, and the true desire to make America and the world a better place.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    One of the ways I help is by donating to the USO.  By clicking the banner above, you can donate to the USO, as well.  You can do it anonymously, by donating in memory of a fallen soldier.  Remember my motto:  If we each do a little, we can all do a lot.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Even if you're like me and don't support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, please support the troops.  They don't choose the wars to start, they just fight them with honor and dignity.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    To all enlisted and veteran soldiers:  Thank You.
