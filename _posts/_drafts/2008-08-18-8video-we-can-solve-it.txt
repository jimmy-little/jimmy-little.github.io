    This is the latest ad for the <a href="http://www.wecansolveit.org" target="_blank">We Can Solve It </a>campaign.  The "RePower America" campaign is out to inform and educate the people about climate change and what we can do about it.  I'm not going to take a bunch of time here to re-blog everything about WeCanSolveIt, but I encourage everyone to go to the website and look around, sign the petition, and help us get on the way to energy independence. Check the video and a mini-rant after the break.
