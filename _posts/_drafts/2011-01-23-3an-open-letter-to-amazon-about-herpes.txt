  </p>
  
  <p>
    You should really work on this.  Today, after cleaning my dog's ears (and my own) using a popular name-brand cotton swab, I noticed I was running low.  As a dedicated customer and Amazon Prime free-shipping member for several years, I dutifully go to my iMac and type "Q Tip" into your search box.  I get a very comprehensive list of several different retailers offering me this fine personal hygiene product.  In the sidebar, I also get the recommendations pictured.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I get all of the department choices, and the choices between swabs and balls.  But the "Surviving Herpes" Listmania choice confuses me.  As someone who has recently bought a USB microphone, a computer headset, a video-editing shuttle controller, and a couple of environmental Kindle books (to read on my iPad), how exactly does a Q Tip search change my Listmania recommendation to those related to sexually transmitted disease?  Is there some sort of connection between herpes and cotton on a stick?  Also, can you explain why the aforementioned list is headed by a graphic of a dog toy I recently purchased?

    Your prompt response is appreciated.
