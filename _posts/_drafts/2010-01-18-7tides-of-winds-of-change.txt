    You may have noticed a slight change here at channelJimmy.  I'm going through a "simple" phase right now, where I think the content is key.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    It's subtle, going from black to white and all&#8230;  In the coming weeks and months, I intend to update the blog more often and I'll be doing a lot of things publicly, so the news section will get updated far more often.  I'm also working on sections with episode guides and more.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The "white album" phase will last until I get bored with it.  Once OLED screens become more prevalent, I'll switch to a black background to save energy.  (FYI&#8230; OLED screens basically have individually backlit pixels, so black pixels are just "off")  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Until then, enjoy the blanco simplicity of channelJimmy.
