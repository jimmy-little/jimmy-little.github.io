  DYKElectric cars seem to be the next big thing in enviro-friendliness.  But consider this&#8230;  If you get your electricity from a coal burning power plant, a gasoline automobile that gets 40 MPG is comparable to an electric car as far as the environment is concerned.</p> 
  
  <p>
    <strong><<<MATH ALERT>>> </strong> A normal electric car takes 2,800 BTUs of energy to go a mile.  A gallon of gas produces about 125,000 BTU's.  Divide by 20, and a gasoline car that gets 20 MPG needs 6250 BTUs to go the same distance.  That's two and a half times more pollution.  Drive a 15MPG SUV, we're talking 8350BTUs!
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Up that mileage to 44 MPG, and we're talking the same amount of fossil fuel energy to run an electric car or an efficient gasoline automobile.

  <p>
    What do you take from this?  If your neighborhood gets it's electricity from a clean plant, be it an updated coal plant, natural gas, hydro- or solar- power, you're better off with an electric.  If you're like 85% of the country and get your electricity from coal, stick with a gas-sipping hybrid or compact.
