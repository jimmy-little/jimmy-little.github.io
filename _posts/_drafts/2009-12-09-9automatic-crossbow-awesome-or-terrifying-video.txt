    Sometimes, you think to yourself, "Self, I'd really like one, but it doesn't exist."  Then you think "Well, hell&#8230;  I can build it.  How hard can it be?"  Well, I think this guy had that conversation with himself at some point.  The part that bothers me is you never see what he's shooting at&#8230;
