  OK, It may never happen here.  As a victim of more than one bike theft in New York, I would pay for this kind of storage.  The video is in Japanese, as far as I can tell, but the gist is this:  
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Put your bike on the sled
    </li>
    <p>
      <li>
        Swipe your card
      </li>
      <p>
        <li>
          Walk Away
        </li>
        <p>
          <li>
            Swipe Card
          </li>
          <p>
            <li>
              Get Bike Back
            </li>
            <p>
              </ul> 
              
              <p>
                <div>
                  It's simple, stores HUNDREDS of bikes in a secure, weatherproof underground facility, and encourages alternate transportation.  Imagine one of these at a suburban train station.  Ride bike to station, park it in one of these facilities, and take the train to the city.  At the other end of the train, you either jump on a subway or bus, or (what I would do) have a second bike on the city end in another parking facility.
                
                
                <p>
                  <div>
                    With increased traffic, parking prices, tolls, congestion pricing, and more making driving into cities more and more expensive, this may take off.
                  
                  
                  <p>
