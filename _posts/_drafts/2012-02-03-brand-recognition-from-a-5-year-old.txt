  <p>
    Two and a half minutes of adorable.  A 5 year old's take on brand recognition.  She recognizes what almost every logo is, such as the "Eye" of CBS, but doesn't know what they stand for.
  </p>
  
  <p>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    She recognizes, by name, the following brands:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Disney
    </li>
    <li>
      Apple
    </li>
    <li>
      GE ("that's where my grandpa works")
    </li>
    <li>
      McDonalds
    </li>
    <li>
      Nike
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
     She recognizes as correct products, but not by name:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      Pepsi
    </li>
    <li>
      KFC
    </li>
    <li>
      Starbucks
    </li>
    <li>
      BP
    </li>
    <li>
      Mercedes ("on a car, looks like a peace sign!")
    </li>
    <li>
      Panera
    </li>
    <li>
      Xbox ("that's what you use to control the TV at Ryan's house")
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    My favorite quote:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      That is a parade elephant
    </p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    If she only knew&#8230;
