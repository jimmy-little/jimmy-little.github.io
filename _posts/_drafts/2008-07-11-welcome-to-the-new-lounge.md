  So, as you've no doubt noticed, things are a bit different around here.  I've transferred the entire site to a new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-end_database" target="_blank">backend</a>.  I'm now using <a href="http://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a>, and I'm liking it.  It was a little bit of a chore, to rewrite all the links and reorganize all the posts, but I think it's worth it.</p> 
  
  <p>
    Now, new posts appear right here on top of the home page.  You can always get to category views in the sidebar.  You have one-click access to all my social networks in the sidebar.  I can now categorize articles more specifically.  I can post one article in multiple categories, so I don't have to choose whether I put bamboo flooring in "green" or "home".  Now, it's in both.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Also new, is commenting.  You can now comment on articles and posts.  Just scroll to the bottom of the page, and type it in.  No registration required!  If you already signed up for the old site, forget it.  Now, just type in your name, email, and comment.
  </p>

    Hopefully, I'll be able to update more often now.  Enjoy the NEW Lounge!
