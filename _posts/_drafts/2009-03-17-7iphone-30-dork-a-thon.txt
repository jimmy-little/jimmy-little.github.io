  <img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-299" title="iphone-3-new-1jpg" src="http://s3.media.squarespace.com/production/453260/5085149/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/iphone-3-new-1jpg-300x233.jpg" alt="iphone-3-new-1jpg" width="300" height="233" />Ok, I'll admit it.  I'm a geek.  Anyone who reads this site regularly (both of you&#8230;) knows that.  I just spent an hour of my life watching a LiveBlog of the latest Apple iPhone announcement &#8211; the 3.0 Software roadmap.  Yep, that's right.  Not even a release of anything, just a description of what is to come.  And it's pretty exciting.</p> 
  
  <p>
    The event started with the normal "we've sold a zillion iPhones and two zillion Apps&#8230;" spiel, but then they started going thru the new stuff&#8230;
  </p>
  
  <p>
    First, focus on the developers.   They've opened up over 1000 new APIs (Application Programming Interface) to the development community.  Long story short&#8230; Mac OS X and iPhone OS are pretty much the same thing.  They use modules called "Cores" to make things happen.  "Core Animation", "Core Audio", and "Core Location" are a few.  Apple opens some of these cores to developers, and keeps some private.  They just opened a whole mess of 'em for the developers&#8230;<br /> 
    
    <h3>
      Developer Updates
    </h3>
    
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In-App purchases.  You can buy an app, then buy more stuff within that app&#8230;  Buy a "Lite" version for a buck to try it, then upgrade features within the app, without going back to the iTunes store.  Or buy more game levels, or more episodes of a streaming subscription.  The good news is, you can only have In-App purchases on a paid app, so you don't get bugged to "upgrade" free apps.
        </li>
        <p>
          <li>
            Push Alerts.  This was promised a while ago, but had to be rebuilt due to demand.  Some companies (see ESPN below) want to push 50,000 alerts a month.  It is rebuilt and (allegedly) working now.  IM apps, sports apps, Facebook, Twitter, and more can now toss a pop-up at your phone to say <em>"Dude, you've got an update.  Stop doing whatever important task you're working on and pay attention to your phone now"</em>
          </li>
          <p>
            <li>
              Streaming Video.  ESPN demo'd an app that checks scores, alerts you of changes in games you follow using Push Alerts, not SMS, and can live-stream games for an extra fee (see, that In-App purchase thing at work, already!)
            </li>
            <p>
              <li>
                Opened the Bluetooth stack (Stereo audio, syncing, pairing with other things now possible)
              </li>
              <p>
                <li>
                  Opened proximity sensor.  It's that little eye that turns off the touchscreen when you put the phone to your head.  It can also trigger events, like in the moderately illegal Google app that turns on Voice Search when the prox sensor is activated.  They weren't supposed to do that.  Now they can.
                </li>
                <p>
                  <li>
                    Other apps can now access your media library.  Electronic Arts demo'd a Sims game where a Sim-dude went to his "stereo" and started playing music that was pulled from the media side of the phone.
                  </li>
                  <p>
                    <li>
                      Peer-to-peer connectivity.  Link up 2 iPhones/Touches with WiFi or Bluetooth to share contacts, play a multi-player game, or send pictures.
                    </li>
                    <p>
                      <li>
                        Accessory support.  They've opened the dock connector a bit to allow more input/output.  They demo'd an FM transmitter that is just a little bud, and all the controls pop up on screen.  They also demo'd a blood glucose meter for diabetics that interfaces with the iPhone.  It will read your strips and keep a record of insulin needs, your diet, exercise, and other important info.  You can also set up the app to e-mail someone when you test, which would be great for caretakers of children and the elderly.
                      </li>
                      <p>
                        <li>
                          Embeddable Maps.  Now, if you tap on a location in "Yelp", for instance, it shows a Google Map within Yelp, it doesn't toss you to Google Maps.  Great time saver, I think&#8230;
                        </li>
                        <p>
                          <li>
                            GPS velocity and direction.  These things were always there, but hidden from developers.  Now that they're open, Turn-By-Turn directions won't be far behind.  You do need to bring your own maps for turn-by-turn, though.  Probably better, anyway.  Can't rely on a 3G connection to get Google Maps everywhere.
                          </li>
                          <p>
                            <li>
                              In-App e-mail.  You can now send e-mail from within an app, not just the e-mail app.  Oracle demo'd an inventory app that sent a Push Alert to the iPhone (which has Oracle's Database on it) to say a product was low in inventory.  The Oracle guy could then pull up the order from within the database and send an email to the customer about the the lack of inventory.  Never left the App.  Pretty cool&#8230;
                            </li>
                            <p>
                              <li>
                                Streaming Audio
                              </li>
                              <p>
                                <li>
                                  Shake API
                                </li>
                                <p>
                                  <li>
                                    More Data Detectors (that's when a date in an email or web page is recognized, and you can tap on it to add to the calendar, or the same with a phone number or e-mail address&#8230;)
                                  </li>
                                  <p>
                                    <li>
                                      Toolbar API
                                    </li>
                                    <p>
                                      <li>
                                        Core Data
                                      </li>
                                      <p>
                                        <li>
                                          In-Game Chat
                                        </li>
                                        <p>
                                          <li>
                                            A bunch more like "Battery API", "Cell Styles", and UI Action Sheet" that were shown on a slide, but not described.
                                          </li>
                                          <p>
                                            </ul> 
                                            
                                            <p>
                                              <h3>
                                                Consumer Updates
                                              </h3>
                                              
                                              <p>
                                                <ul>
                                                  <li>
                                                    Cut, Copy, Paste.  Finally.  It took them 3 revisions to put in what my Palm/Qualcomm PDQ had in 1997.  But it works, and it looks like it works very well.  Double tap to bring up a blue dot on each end of a word.  Tap and hold to select a paragraph.  You can drag the blue dots to select, then tap Cut or Copy.  Go to another app, or another place on the page, and tap to select insertion, tap Paste.  Works across all apps.  If you paste or cut something you don't want, shake the phone to bring up the Undo dialog.  Easy.
                                                  </li>
                                                  <p>
                                                    <li>
                                                      E-Mail multiple photos.  This has been a real sticking point to some, I don't particularly care.  But it works easily enough.
                                                    </li>
                                                    <p>
                                                      <li>
                                                        Landscape.  Now, every Apple App has landscape.  Messaging (formerly SMS), Mail, Notes, and the rest can all use the landscape keyboard.  Nice for a fat-fingered guy like me.
                                                      </li>
                                                      <p>
                                                        <li>
                                                          Messaging.  Used to be "SMS", but now they've (finally) added MMS (picturemail) and message forwarding.  You can also delete individual messages without deleting the whole conversation.  Nice.
                                                        </li>
                                                        <p>
                                                          <li>
                                                            Built-In Voice Memos.  Not a big deal, there's like 10 free apps that do it, but this one syncs to iTunes and is Apple-Pretty.
                                                          </li>
                                                          <p>
                                                            <li>
                                                              Calendars.  Now supports subscription calendars, .ics calendars (Google and Yahoo calendars), and CalDAV protocols.
                                                            </li>
                                                            <p>
                                                              <li>
                                                                Universal Search.  This is the reason I jailbroke, and the reason I'll un-jailbreak.  Now, from your home screen, there's an extra page.  From the home screen, swipe LEFT one page to bring up Spotlight.  Your four "Dock" apps are at the bottom, and a search box at the top.  Type in the search box, and the page populates with e-mails, contacts, text messages, songs, notes, and apps that contain those words.  If it's as quick as the demo, it'll change my life.  Again, though&#8230;  I had this on a Palm in 1997.
