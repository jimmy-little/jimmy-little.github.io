<div data-src="v5">
  <img src="images/articles/didyouknow.png" alt="dyk" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="120" height="42" align="left" />over 25 billion (with a B) plastic water bottles are tossed away each year?  It requires about 1.5 million barrells of oil to produce these bottles, and at todays prices, that's over $1,665,000,000 in crude.  Ditch the single serve bottles and opt for a water cooler.  Its cheaper, and since those 5 gallon jugs get sanitized and reused, it's greener.  Better yet, break out the Brita.  Filtering your own water saves even more green.  Just make sure to use a stainless steel or Nalgene water bottle for those refills; regular plastic bottles can harbor bacteria that could make you sick.
