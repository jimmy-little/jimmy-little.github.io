    On an appropriately dreary day, with rain and cold weather dominating the weather forecast, I rode my bike over to the<a href="http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/" target="_blank"> Oklahoma City National Memorial</a>.  You can read all about it over on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oklahoma_City_bombing" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>, but here's the gist:  In April 1995, two ex-Army pro-militia survivalists executed the largest terrorist attack to date in America.  168 people died, hundreds were injured, and over 300 buildings were damaged in the blast.

    I spent a couple of hours taking pictures.  Check out my Flickr set below.

    After the recent 10 year anniversary of 9/11, and seeing this today, consider this: Americans have been on a decade-long crusade with our "War On Terror." There have been a couple of wars, billions spent on new governmental agencies like the TSA and Homeland Security, countless anti-Mosque lawsuits and a general fear of brown people with a religion or language Americans just can't or won't understand.  But sometimes, it's just an angry white guy with an anti-government bent.
