    <span style=" text-align: center; display: block; margin: 0 auto 10px;"></span>This 6 minute video will change the way you look at the world. Ever since he retired from the construction industry, he's been perfecting a technique of leverage, balance, gravity, and simple tools (sticks and rocks) to move heavy things. He's moved everything from one ton blocks of concrete to an entire barn.His ultimate goal is to build a replica of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>. The end of the video shows how he took a 22,000 pound block from laying flat on the ground, to standing vertical. It's the first in the Stonehenge project.
