    When I got home tonight, I did my normal routine.  Unleash the dog, leave my shoes by the door, and turn on cable news.  My TV was left on MSNBC from this morning, and I caught the last three minutes of "Countdown with Keith Olbermann"  It ended up being the very last three minutes.

    For whatever reason, Olbermann and MSNBC cancelled his four year contract that still had two years left.  Some say he quit, some say he was fired, some say he quit because he knew Comcast would fire him once they take over NBC.  It really doesn't matter.

    What does matter is the future.  Olbermann was the network's highest rated talent.  He needs to take that audience with him.  There is a rumored clause in the dissolution agreement that keeps Olbermann off television for an undisclosed amount of time.  I know from my basic cable contracts, it's usually 12-24 months.  His mileage will vary, I'm sure.  He may have a little more pull than me&#8230;

    Keith:  Don't just wait.  Use this opportunity to move to new media.  Satellite radio has been huge for Howard Stern, Martha Stewart, and more.  Think of it like cable for radio.  You can get radio for free, but you get better, less restricted radio if you pay.  I'd listen.  But that's 2002 thinking.  Think 2011.

    Podcasting has become a real-life way to get the message out and make money.  Several huge companies advertise on podcasts.  And podcasts have a much higher rate per thousand viewers than TV does.  You can have a sustained income doing what you want on your podcast network.  Try it out.  See if it works.  You have some time to kill.
