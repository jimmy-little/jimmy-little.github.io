  * Senator Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) voted NO on FEMA Funding.
  * Senator Tom Coburn (R-Oklahoma)  voted NO on FEMA Funding.
  * Rep. Jim Bridenstine (R-Oklahoma) voted NO on FEMA Funding for Hurricane Sandy Relief.
  * Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Oklahoma) voted NO on FEMA Funding for Hurricane Sandy Relief. 

 

After the mega-tornado blasted through Moore, OK on May 20, FEMA was there, as they should have been.  There are thousands of people who are displaced and homeless.  Clean up will take months, if not years.  Entire neighborhoods need to be rebuilt. 

Yet these 4 people who supposedly represent the people of Oklahoma don't think that's how it should work.  Come on, Okies, pick yourself up by your bootstraps!  We don't need no stinkin' Feds!

Bullshit.  Every state uses federal funding for something.  If I were the head of FEMA, I would demand a public apology from these four "representatives of the people" for their politicized votes and ask that they admit that federal disaster relief is sometimes the only way to get back to a new normal.

If I were a spiteful type, I'd just tell them they're on their own.  You can't vote against money, then take that money home.  It doesn't work that way.

I anticipate their apologies. Go ahead, we'll wait.
