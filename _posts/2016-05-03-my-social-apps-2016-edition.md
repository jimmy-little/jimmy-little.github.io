I've been converting my Squarespace blog over to Jekyll.  It's been fun learning new things (including basic Javascript and Ruby), and seeing old posts.  

When updating some tags, I saw [this post](http://www.cocktailsandcoffee.com/writing/as-time-goes-by/) from 2012 with the social folder on my iPhone.

### Some observations:


 - Still using Tweetbot
 
 - Starting to use Instagram again (well, again-again...)
 
 - Still use (and hate) Facebook and LinkedIn
 
 - Foursquare has given way to Swarm.  Same shit, different app.
 
 - Glympse is still hanging in there, but Find My Friends has really replaced it.
 
 - RIP Netbot, Google Voice, and Google+
 
 - I really enjoy Timehop
 
 - Periscope, but I hardly open it.
 
 - Twitterific is there for nostalgia. Twitter is there because some stuff just doesn't work in third-party apps.
 
 - Peach.  ðŸ˜´
 
 - I'm deleting Tumblr now.  Forgot it was there.
 

I also see how I've changed the folder name from "Social" to "Connect" to "Waste Time" with a toilet emoji.  

Seems about right.
