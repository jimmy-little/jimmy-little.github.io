    The soon-to-be-wildly popular <a href="http://www.bugdogstudios.com/everything">We Only Talk About Everything</a> podcast is being joined by the overly hilarious <a href="http://www.bugdogstudios.com/mandates">Movie ManDates</a> over at Bug Dog Studios!  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Movie Mandates is a show where one guy is forced to go on a Man Date and watch a movie he's never seen by two (or more) of his more culturally endowed friends.  Good stuff.  Go listen.
