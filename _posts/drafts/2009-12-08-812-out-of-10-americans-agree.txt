    I took statistics in high school.  Based on sample size, you get a margin of error (MOE).  The larger the sample, the smaller the margin of error.  As a consumer of cable news from all sides, these polls usually have a MOE of +/-3%.  That means there is a sample size of about 1060.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Rasmussen Reports, a company that does polls for a living, (mostly for Fox News) put up a poll asking this:
  </p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Did scientists falsify research reports to fit their theories on Global Warming?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      And the results were:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        59% Somewhat Likely
      </li>
      <li>
        35% Think it's Very Likely
      </li>
      <li>
        26% Think it's Not Very Likely
      </li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>
    Now, I'm no rocket scientist, but I got out of third grade &#8216;rithmatic with flying colors.  That adds up to 120%. The best part is that Steve Doocy even says the first two numbers are "95%" then says the other 26% think it's not likely.

    I'm a fair guy.  I'm an independent guy.  I'm not a member of a political party, and I get my news from a lot of places.  "Self," I was thinking,"maybe Fox just rewrote the poll and those "Very Likely" people were a subset of the "Somewhat Likely" group.  It would be falsifying a result to fit their agenda, and it would be delicious irony.  So, I went to the source.

    BUT NO!!  The poll, which I found using this new-fangled thing on the interweb called "Google" can be found on <a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/environment_energy/americans_skeptical_of_science_behind_global_warming" target="_blank">Rasmussen Reports</a>.  And, sadly, this is the way the report is written.

    Rasmussen is obviously a right-leaning pollster.  Some recent polls are titled "Tea Party Tops GOP on Three Ballots", "41% Favor, 51% Oppose Health Care Plan", and "Number of Democrats Falls to a Four Year Low".  If you click on the "In the News" portion of the site, you'll see quotes by Minority Leader John Boehner, and polls quoted in the Christian Science Monitor, Fox News, a couple local Fox stations, and the only poll in the top 15 in a "liberal" paper is in the San Francisco Chronicle, and that story is about Barbara Boxer's "thumping" being "good for a GOPer."

    Lesson of the day:  Ignore polls.  They are crap, especially when they are biased.  Scott Rasmussen is a shill.  Fox News is fine in the midday, but the prime time lineup is decidedly Right.  The morning show can be run by anyone who reads good.  (Poor grammar intentional&#8230;)  And MSNBC is no better.  They are pushing a pro-climate agenda, including a recent story I've seen all over the place about a federal law requiring a homeowner to replace appliances when selling their house to meet Energy Star requirements.  This would be a very lucrative law for MSNBC's parent company (for now) General Electric.  More on that soon.

        Apparently, I'm not the only one who noticed.  Jon Stewart did a great bit on his show.  [<a class="offsite-link-inline" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/113805/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-tue-dec-8-2009?c=449:558" target="_blank">Hulu Link</a>]
