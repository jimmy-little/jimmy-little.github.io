    If you're not reading <a href="http://www.theonion.com" target="_blank">The Onion</a>, you should be. (ignore the unnecessary Flash header).  If you're not following <a href="http://www.twitter.com/baratunde" target="_blank">Baratunde Thurston on Twitter</a>, you should be.  If you're not masturbating in movie theaters, well, that's up to you.
