  Texas Oil Man T. Boone Pickens has a plan. It is aptly named <a href="http://www.pickensplan.org" target="_blank">PickensPlan</a> (catchy, huh?) The plan is a way to reduce our dependency on foreign oil by harnessing wind. Here's the Cliff's Notes 
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      The U.S. has the most pronounced wind corridor in the world, providing endless, free, natural fuel to power wind turbines.
    </li>
    <p>
      <li>
        The wind turbines will produce over 20% of the nation's electrical power.
      </li>
      <p>
        <li>
          Currently, natural gas provides over 20% of the nation's electrical power.
        </li>
        <p>
          <li>
            Take the natural gas that's being saved by wind, and put it into transportation.
          </li>
          <p>
            <li>
              Oil needs for transportation will go down 38% by transferring the natural gas from power to transportation.
            </li>
            <p>
              <li>
                Our foreign oil costs will drop over $300 billion annually. Within 10 years.
              </li>
              <p>
                <li>
                  The technology is there. Wind turbines exist. Natural Gas vehicles exist. no more inventing is needed, just production
                </li>
                <p>
                  </ul> 
                  
                  <p>
                    <p style="text-align: center;">
                      This is no "Inconvenient Truth" in terms of production value, but it is interesting. Check out the video:<br />
