    I just booked a flight home for Thanksgiving.  It's a short trip of about 250 miles from New York to Northern Virginia.  Usually, I'd get a Prius from Zipcar and buzz down there.  Unfortunately, I've been busy and absentminded, so I didn't book one.  Now, there are no cars left.

  <p>
    So, I hopped online and booked a paperless ticket on JetBlue, which is probably my favorite airline.  I like the comfy seats, the DirectTV, the fact they still have pillows and snacks&#8230;  but my favorite thing about it is it encourages purchasing carbon offsets for your travel.

    On the confirmation page, after you've picked and paid for your flight, there is a link to <a href="http://www.carbonfund.org" target="_blank">CarbonFund.org.</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    On the CarbonFund page, you can plug in the mileage of your flight and get a buyback number.  You can also just click buttons for $5 or $10 buybacks.  The buyback for my flight was about $3.  
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The money collected from carbon buybacks are used to finance renewable energy, recycling programs, transportation programs, reforestation, and other conservation projects.

    The company's motto is "Reduce what you can, offset what you can't"  Seems like a good idea, if you ask me.
