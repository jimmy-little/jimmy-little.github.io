  OK, first of all, a couple of disclaimers: 
  
  <ol>
    <li>
      I don't agree with a lot of what PeTA does.  I am an animal lover, but PeTA gets a little crazy sometimes.  I'm not defending them in general, I'm defending one particular incident.  In fact, I'm not even linking to the PeTA site from here.  I am however embedding their banned Superbowl ad.
    </li>

        I'm a mostly-vegetarian, so I agree with the basis of this message.  I do eat fish occasionally, and try to buy only wild-caught, not farm-raised, fish when I do eat it.
      </li>
      <p>
        <li>
          As soon as the commercial is over, stop the video, or you have to sit thru an old-school crazy-PeTA ad.

                    Are you buying?

                      I'm all for capitalism, but I'm not all that crazy about consumerism.  People see smart, sexy ads on TV and go out and spend money they don't have to buy stuff they don't need.  I don't like it, but we all do it.
                    
                    
                    <p>
                      <div>
                        The Superbowl is the epitome of consumerism.  A quick look at the <a href="http://www.superbowl.com" target="_blank">Superbowl 43</a> site shows embedded graphics by Cadillac, Chunky Soup, and Pepsi.  Ads for the Superbowl go for over a million dollars for a 30 second spot.  Go capitalism!, right?
                      
                      
                      <p>
                        <div>
                          One company that had a million dollars to burn was actually selling something that could help Americans get healthier. Unfortunately, the people who approved sexy ads for <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c81eRD2v0FY&feature=related" target="_blank">energy drinks</a>, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BbYUZUgrrDw&feature=related" target="_blank">underwear</a>, and even a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oDe0JbBJn4&feature=related" target="_blank">naked Will Ferrell</a>, wouldn't approve an ad promoting eating more vegetables.  They would, however approve a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PXFK-iYW3U&feature=related" target="_blank">web hosting commercial</a> where a woman humiliates herself in front a fake congressional committee.  
                        
                        
                        <p>
                          <div>
                            The excuse NBC uses is that it's too sexually explicit for it's viewers.  (One quote from the complaint is actually "asparagus on her lap appearing as if it is ready to be inserted into vagina".)  The way I look at it, it's not any more explicit than any other "sexy" commercial that people have come to expect during the Superbowl.  I think it's more of the fact that Chunky Soup, Outback Steakhouse, and other "manly" meat filled advertisers pay too much money to be intertwined with a sexy woman "touching her breast with her hand while eating broccoli".
                          
                          
                          <p>
                            <div>
                              If NBC wants to make the Superbowl a "family friendly event", they need to ban ads like this.  They also need to ban ads for beer, Victoria's Secret, horror movies, Tanqueray, condoms, and unhealthy junk food and sodas.  They won't of course.  They'd go bankrupt.  But don't get all fake moral-y on us just because you don't like what the ad is selling.
