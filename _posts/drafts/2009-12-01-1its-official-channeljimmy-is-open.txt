  <p>
    I'm still toying with some re-designs and what-not, but I've officially closed down other sites, namely the old Carpentry Lounge. 
  </p>
  
  <p>
    "Why?", you ask?  Well, my interests have evolved and my future plans have changed as well.  I started my first website way back in 1996 when I had an AOL homepage my junior year of college.  I set it up as a portfolio to document my scenic design and architecture work.  I thought it would help get me a job.  It didn't.  It did, however, teach me HTML 1.2, hard-coding web pages, and how to set up a site so it was easy to change a page or a banner.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Fast forward 13 years, and I'm still doing it.  The Carpentry Lounge began as a showcase for my home makeover tv work and my interest in sustainable building.  All of that is still true.  But I'm neck-deep in technology, computers (mostly Mac!), gadgets, sustainable building, social media, live-streaming, politics, and more.  The "Carpentry Lounge" was too narrow.  Maybe channelJimmy is too wide.  We'll find out together.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    I've imported all the old articles from the Lounge, and I'm working on categorizing and tagging them all.  I've also started a new section, "NEWS", that basically updates you on what show I'm currently working on, or where I am in this great big world.  This way, if you only care about what I'm doing, and not what I think, you don't have to sift thru the opinion, which will be far more opinionated now.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    We're working on some great things for the site, including possible live streaming (or at least recorded clips) of Don't Sweat It and Dear Genevieve behind-the-scenes fun!  Stay tuned.
