  Jimmy's Carpentry Lounge is one year old!  On October 4, 2007, I wrote the first post on Carpentry Lounge.  It's gone through a few incarnations since then; with design changes, shifts in content, and a switch from <a href="http://www.joomla.org" target="_blank">Joomla</a> to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org" target="_blank">WordPress</a>.  </p> 
  
  <p>
    There are more changes coming!  I was having some internal struggles about leaving comments open, and I've decided to shut them down for now.  I've been getting far more comment spam than comments, and even though a fantastic program, Askimet, on my server catches most of it, I get an e-mail every time it thinks something is spam.  Long story short, I don't have time to deal with it, so (for now) comments will be disabled.  I encourage you to e-mail me using the contact page, and I can get back to you that way.
  </p>

    There will also be a shift in content coming up.  I'm stepping out of TV until spring of 2009, and going back to being a traveling stagehand.  In a few weeks, I'll be flying scenery on Disney's High School Musical, and in December, I'll be flying people in Disney's Tarzan.

    I'll still post eco-advice and some tech opinions, but I'm going to start blogging about touring as well.  This whole Lounge thing started as a spin-off of my <em>real </em>website, www.jimmy-little.com.  Now, The Lounge has taken over, and jimmy-little.com is just redirected here.  That's OK with me.

    Stay tuned for stories from the road.  I'll get into why we travel, how we travel, and what the life of a Broadway Carny is all about.  I'm planning packing now.  It's an ordeal, thanks to the airlines.  A 50 lb bag doesn't hold much, when you're living out of it for months at a time.

    Upcoming posts will include:  How I travel all my computer, video, and photo gear safely, how stagehands become emotionally attached to their workboxes, and more.  It's going to be a ride.
