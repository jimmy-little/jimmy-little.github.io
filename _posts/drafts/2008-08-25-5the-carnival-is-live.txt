    The Carnival is a group of all the misfits (i.e. sideshow freaks) who help keep the show running and make me look good.  I said to myself: &#8216;Jimmy, you need to give these guys some attention.  They deserve it.'  I know what you're thinking&#8230;  &#8216;Jimmy, why do you talk to yourself in the third person?'  Don't worry about that.  Just enjoy the Carnival!
