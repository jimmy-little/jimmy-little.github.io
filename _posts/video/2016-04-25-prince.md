I'm not big on posting about dead celebrities. Art affects people deeply, whether it's music, acting, painting, or whatever the shit the Kardashians do.  I happen to really like music. I was never a huge fan of Prince, but I always knew he was a great musician and he put on a hell of a show.

A lot of people have been posting a video of a George Harrison tribute where Tom Petty, Steve Winwood, Jeff Lynne, Prince, and a Dhani Harrison play "While My Guitar Gently Weeps". Prince doesn't sing, but he plays the guitar solo.  A few things stand out in this video, to me:

 - Tom Petty is wearing purple, not Prince.  Weird.
 - Prince out-Jimi-Hendrixes Jimi Hendrix, without really trying.
 - About 4:40 in, Prince leans off the stage into the arms of a big guy who I assume is his bodyguard, then gets pushed back onto stage. This was obviously a planned gag, but he does it without missing a beat.
 - This is the best part: at the very end of the song, Prince takes his guitar off and throws it in the air.  **IT NEVER COMES BACK**.  Where the hell did it go?

Freaking magic, man.
