  Two and a half minutes of adorable.  A 5 year old's take on brand recognition.  She recognizes what almost every logo is, such as the "Eye" of CBS, but doesn't know what they stand for.

<!-- more -->  

She recognizes, by name, the following brands:

 - Disney
 - Apple
 - GE ("that's where my grandpa works")
 - McDonalds
 - Nike

She recognizes as correct products, but not by name:

 - Pepsi
 - KFC
 - Starbucks
 - BP
 - Mercedes ("on a car, looks like a peace sign!")
 - Panera
 - Xbox ("that's what you use to control the TV at Ryan's house")

My favorite quote:

 > That is a parade elephant

If she only knew...
