### About Cocktails & Coffee

This site is completely written, researched, and updated by me, Jimmy Little.  It is meant to be a personal and sometimes professional outlet for information about me, what I'm interested in, and what I'm doing. All views here are my own. It's called Cocktails & Coffee because a lot of what I write is fueled by caffeine and alcohol. Or internet rage, But `cocktailsandcoffeeandinternetrage.com` doesn't fit on a business card.

### Content

Everything here is written by me.  If I quote another site or video, it is always attributed and linked to.  Don't steal content.  That makes you an unproductive douche.

### Workflow

The new Cocktails and Coffee is a work in progress. It's a Jekyll blog, which means it's completely static. I type the posts in Markdown, and then let GitHub generate the pages. I do it this way because it lets me keep all my posts in plain text. I work mostly on iOS and use [Working Copy](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-powerful-git/id896694807?mt=8) to push to GitHub. It's a kind of a bitch to set up, but once it's working, it's seamless.

Wordpress and Squarespace were super easy, but they were pretty heavy for a blog. Static is where it's at for me right now. If opening a terminal or looking at CSS scares you, stick with Squarespace. It really was awesome when I used it.

### Images

Images on this site are either my own, Royalty Free, Creative Commons, or pulled from the source of the article I'm quoting. If they require attribution, they get an overlay credit. Artists need to make a living, so I make sure they get the credit they deserve.  Don't just Google for images and use them. That's stealing.  Thieves are dicks.  

### Web Standards

If the site doesn’t display properly it's because you are not using a standards-compliant browser. This site is HTML 5 and CSS 3 compliant, with minimal JavaScript. It's simple, which is why I switched to Jekyll. To properly display the site, switch to a modern, standards-compliant browser like Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.  Don't e-mail me that the site looks like shit with Internet Explorer, there's nothing I can do about that.  

If you are using a grown-up web browser and have an issue, please [let me know](mailto:thejimmylittle@gmail.com). 

This site uses responsive CSS, so it should look great on all screen sizes. Disclaimer - "looking great" is subjective, and we'll have to just disagree on design choices if you don't like my style. 

### Support the Site

[Support the site by shopping at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fyourstore%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dpd_irl_gw%26signIn%3D1&tag=jimmlitt-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)

By shopping through the Amazon link on this page, a small percentage of the purchases you make comes back to me.  I use the income to pay for this site.  Any income above and beyond that is donated to animal charities.  Also, most of the software and products I link to on this site use affiliate links.  If you click on a link and buy something through iTunes, the App Store, or Amazon, I will get a small percentage of the purchase price back from Apple or Amazon, and it costs you nothing.  That's a damn good deal for everyone.
