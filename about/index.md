### About Cocktails & Coffee

This site is completely written, researched, and updated by me, Jimmy Little.  It is meant to be a personal and sometimes professional outlet for information about me, what I'm interested in, and what I'm doing. All views here are my own. It's called Cocktails & Coffee because a lot of what I write is fueled by caffeine and alcohol. Or internet rage,  But cocktailsandcoffeeandinternetrage.com doesn't fit on a business card.

### Content

Everything here is written by me.  If I quote another site or video, it is always attributed and linked to.  Don't steal content.  That makes you an unproductive douche.

### Workflow

The new Cocktails and Coffee is a work in progress. It's a Jekyll blog, which means it's completely static. I type the posts in Markdown, and then let GitHub generate the pages. I do it this way because it lets me keep all my posts in plain text, and i use [Working Copy](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-powerful-git/id896694807?mt=8) to push to GitHub. It's complicated, but I like it way better than my previous blogs that were on Wordpress, Joomla, and Squarespace. 

Wordpress and Squarespace were super easy, but they were pretty heavy for a blog. Static is where it's at for me right now.

### Images

Images on this site are either my own, Royalty Free, or Creative Commons. If they require attribution, I attribute the crap out of them. They get an overlay credit and a link back to the original. Artists need to make a living, so I make sure they get the credit they deserve.  Don't just Google for images and use them.  That's stealing.  Thieves are dicks.  

### Web Standards

If the site doesn’t display properly it's because you are not using a standards-compliant browser. This site is HTML 5 and CSS 3 compliant, with minimal JavaScript. It's simple, which is why I switched to Jekyll. To properly display the site, switch to a modern, standards-compliant browser like Safari, Chrome, or Firefox.  Don't e-mail me that the site looks like shit with Internet Explorer, there's nothing I can do about that.  If you are using a grown-up web browser and have an issue, please [let me know](mailto:thejimmylittle@gmail.com).  This site uses responsive CSS, so it should look great on all screen sizes.  Disclaimer - "looking great" is subjective, and we'll have to just disagree on design choices if you don't like blue and orange. 

### Support the Site

[Support the site by shopping at Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2Fgp%2Fyourstore%3Fie%3DUTF8%26ref_%3Dpd_irl_gw%26signIn%3D1&tag=jimmlitt-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=390957)

By shopping through the Amazon link on this page, a small percentage of the purchases you make comes back to me.  I use the income to pay for this site.  Any income above and beyond that is donated to animal charities.  Also, most of the software and products I link to on this site use affiliate links.  If you click on a link and buy something through iTunes, the App Store, or Amazon, I will get a small percentage of the purchase price back from Apple or Amazon, and it costs you nothing.  That's a damn good deal for everyone.
