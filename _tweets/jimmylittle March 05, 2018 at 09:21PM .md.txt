<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Apple paid $3 billion for Beats MUSIC not Beats HEADPHONES.

Beats Music is now Apple Music and making $10/month for each of its 30 million subscribers.

That&#39;s $3 billion every 10 months. Seems like a good deal to me.

Beats Headphones are junk and Apple should kill the brand.</p>&mdash; jimmy little (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/970892083283214337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2018</a></blockquote>
