<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">President Obama Yesterday revealed what he told Trump about ObamaCare:

These are the words of a real President</p>&mdash; Brian Krassenstein (@krassenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/krassenstein/status/1012700464926875648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2018</a></blockquote>
