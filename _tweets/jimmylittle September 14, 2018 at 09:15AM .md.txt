<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I have questions:

If they didn&#39;t know about Feinstein&#39;s letter alleging sexual misconduct, why did they have this letter signed by 65 women?

Or, 

If they really didn&#39;t know about the Feinstein letter, how did they get 65 signatures from ppl known 35 years ago in 24 hours? <a href="https://t.co/unX51wvSus">https://t.co/unX51wvSus</a></p>&mdash; jimmy (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1040635145676447744?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
