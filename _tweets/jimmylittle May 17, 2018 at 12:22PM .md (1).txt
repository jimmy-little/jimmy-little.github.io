<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In his remarks, the President just showed: 
He still doesn&#39;t know what a trade deficit is (he seems to think it&#39;s a cash transfer) 
He doesn&#39;t know what the Libyan disarmament program was
He thinks the US invaded Libya and overthrew Qaddafi
Is it biased to point this out?</p>&mdash; ((((Peter Sagal)))) (@petersagal) <a href="https://twitter.com/petersagal/status/997181432161292288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
