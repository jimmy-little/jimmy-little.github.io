<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Just watched the rhetorical gymnastics that <a href="https://twitter.com/IngrahamAngle?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@IngrahamAngle</a> just went through to try to defend the president while admitting that he was a complete taint licking submissive to Putin today.

Shameful. There should be a class action lawsuit against <a href="https://twitter.com/FoxNews?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@FoxNews</a> for using the word “news”</p>&mdash; jimmy little (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1019102236939436036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 17, 2018</a></blockquote>
