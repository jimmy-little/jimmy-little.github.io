<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In the 1640&#39;s the Dutch inhabitants of New Amsterdam built a 12&#39; wall to keep the bad hombres out.

In 1664 the British ignored the wall and took New Amsterdam by sea.

It&#39;s now called New York. 

They took down the wall and built a street. 

It&#39;s called Wall Street. <a href="https://t.co/Cbhp9N8BDW">pic.twitter.com/Cbhp9N8BDW</a></p>&mdash; Joe Delmonaco (@JoeDelmonaco) <a href="https://twitter.com/JoeDelmonaco/status/1082313387189719040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2019</a></blockquote>
