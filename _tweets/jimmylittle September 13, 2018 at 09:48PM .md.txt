<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m happy they brought out the vote, but saying they won “in a sense” is dumb. 

What it means is they brought out as many voters  to vote AGAINST them as they did FOR them. 

That’s why there were more voters and they still lost.   That’s not a win.</p>&mdash; jimmy (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1040462158406938625?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 14, 2018</a></blockquote>
