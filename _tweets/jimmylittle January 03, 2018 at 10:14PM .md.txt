<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Bannon is _technically_ a journalist, as he runs the Breitbart “News” site that Trump used to quote often.

Trump just sent Bannon a cease and desist order, which Bannon should (and will) ignore. 

Trump is clearly violating the First Amendment by trying to silence a journalist.</p>&mdash; jimmy little (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/948799856491073536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2018</a></blockquote>
