<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A 44-year old man with severe mental issues attacked my former high school in the Netherlands today.

Since he did not have access to guns, he brought knives, and was scared away by students throwing their backpacks at him.

The man &amp; students are now all getting help as needed.</p>&mdash; Rami Ismail (@tha_rami) <a href="https://twitter.com/tha_rami/status/971074126470369281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 6, 2018</a></blockquote>
