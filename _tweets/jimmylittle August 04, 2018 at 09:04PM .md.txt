<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Actually, Forbes is not good. Google “Forbes Contributor Network”. Anyone can publish 12 articles on Forbes for about $1500.

Anyone can PAY Forbes to print whatever they write.

Maybe an accredited newspaper or even a cable news network. I’ll even accept Fox News for this.</p>&mdash; jimmy little (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1025955604676788225?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2018</a></blockquote>
