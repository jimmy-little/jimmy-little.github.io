<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I think <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffreyToobin?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jeffreytoobin</a> is being too conservative. Dozens of states have anti-abortion laws still on the books, but they are invalidated by Roe. 

From what Iâ€™ve read - If Roe is overturned, the laws are immediately enforceable without any further action by the state.</p>&mdash; jimmy little (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1012382852590100480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
