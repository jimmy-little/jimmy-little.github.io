<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Car insurance is a good comparison. The reason car insurance is less expensive is because it’s required. If you don’t have insurance, you pay a fee (sounds like ACA...) 

If car insurance were optional, fewer people would buy, causing costs to go way up for those that do want it.</p>&mdash; jimmy (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1078463105665949696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2018</a></blockquote>
