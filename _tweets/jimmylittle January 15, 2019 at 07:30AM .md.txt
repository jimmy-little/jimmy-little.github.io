<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Medicare Advantage is supplemental insurance. It covers what Medicare doesnâ€™t. You have to sign up for Medicare, then opt in to Advantage if you want additional insurance.

Advantage costs less because it covers less.  It covers less because Medicare covers most of it.</p>&mdash; jimmy (@jimmylittle) <a href="https://twitter.com/jimmylittle/status/1085197584971382784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2019</a></blockquote>
